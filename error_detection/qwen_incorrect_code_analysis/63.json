Additionally, return a list of all the integers found in the original list, maintaining their original order.\ndef count_and_extract_integers(strings):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef check_integer(text):\n    text = text.strip()\n    if text[0] in '+-':\n        text = text[1:]\n    return text.isdigit()\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef count_and_extract_integers(strings):\n    integers = []\n    count = 0\n    for s in strings:\n        if check_integer(s):\n            count += 1\n            integers.append(int(s))\n    return count, integers\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert count_and_extract_integers(['123', '+456', '-789', 'abc', '12a']) == (3, [123, 456, -789])\nassert count_and_extract_integers(['+0', '-0', '0', '00', '0a']) == (4, [0, 0, 0, 0])\nassert count_and_extract_integers(['abc', 'def', 'ghi']) == (0, [])\nassert count_and_extract_integers([]) == (0, [])\nassert count_and_extract_integers(['123', '456', '789']) == (3, [123, 456, 789])\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
