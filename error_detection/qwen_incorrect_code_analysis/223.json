Return a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the respective sublist contains consecutive numbers or not.\ndef check_Consecutive_Sublists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(l):\n    return sorted(l) == list(range(min(l),max(l)+1))\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive_Sublists(list_of_lists):\n    def check_Consecutive(l):\n        return sorted(l) == list(range(min(l),max(l)+1))\n    return [check_Consecutive(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive_Sublists([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == [True, True, True]\nassert check_Consecutive_Sublists([[1, 2, 4], [5, 7, 6], [8, 10, 9]]) == [False, True, True]\nassert check_Consecutive_Sublists([[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]) == [True, True, True]\nassert check_Consecutive_Sublists([[1, 3, 2], [6, 5, 4], [9, 8, 7]]) == [True, True, True]\nassert check_Consecutive_Sublists([[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7], [9, 10, 12]]) == [True, True, False]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
