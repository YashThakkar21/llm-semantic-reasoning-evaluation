The function should return a new list of lists where all odd numbers in each sublist are removed.\ndef process_lists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nreturn [remove_odd(sublist) if sublist else [] for sublist in list_of_lists]\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert process_lists([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == [[2], [4, 6], [8]]\nassert process_lists([[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]]) == [[10, 12], [14]]\nassert process_lists([[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]]) == [[20, 22, 24]]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
