The function should return a list of tuples where each tuple is the result of applying the 'multiply_elements' function to the corresponding tuple in the input list. Additionally, the function should also return the sum of all elements in the resulting tuples.\ndef process_tuples(list_of_tuples):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup[:-1], test_tup[1:]))\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(test_tup):\n        return tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup[:-1], test_tup[1:]))\n    \n    result_tuples = [multiply_elements(tup) for tup in list_of_tuples]\n    total_sum = sum(sum(tup) for tup in result_tuples)\n    return result_tuples, total_sum\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert process_tuples([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]) == ([(2, 6), (20, 30)], 58)\nassert process_tuples([(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)]) == ([(1, 1), (4, 4)], 10)\nassert process_tuples([(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5)]) == ([(0, 2), (12, 20)], 34)\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
