If any sublist contains duplicate elements, the function should return False, otherwise it should return True.\ndef all_sublists_unique(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef all_unique(test_list):\n    return len(test_list) == len(set(test_list))\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef all_sublists_unique(list_of_lists):\n    def all_unique(test_list):\n        return len(test_list) == len(set(test_list))\n    return all(all_unique(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert all_sublists_unique([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == True\nassert all_sublists_unique([[1, 2, 2], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == False\nassert all_sublists_unique([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 7, 9]]) == False\nassert all_sublists_unique([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]) == True\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
