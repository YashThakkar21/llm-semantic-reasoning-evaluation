The function should take a string and a dictionary where keys are characters to be replaced and values are the new characters.\ndef replace_multiple_chars(str1, char_map):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef replace_char(str1, ch, newch):\n    return str1.replace(str(ch), str(newch))\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef replace_multiple_chars(str1, char_map):\n    for ch, newch in char_map.items():\n        str1 = str1.replace(str(ch), str(newch))\n    return str1\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert replace_multiple_chars('hello world', {'h': 'j', 'o': 'a'}) == 'jella warld'\nassert replace_multiple_chars('programming', {'g': 'd', 'm': 'n'}) == 'prodrannind'\nassert replace_multiple_chars('python', {'p': 'b', 'y': 'i'}) == 'bithon'\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
