The first list should contain the indices of the first occurrence of each element of the second array in the first array. The second list should contain the indices of the last occurrence of each element of the second array in the first array. If an element from the second array is not found in the first array, its index should be represented as -1 in both lists.\ndef find_indices(arr1, arr2):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn item in dlist, (dlist.index(item) if item in dlist else -1)\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nfirst_occurrences = []\n    last_occurrences = []\n    for item in arr2:\n        found, index = sequential_search(arr1, item)\n        if found:\n            first_occurrences.append(index)\n            last_index = index\n            for i in range(index + 1, len(arr1)):\n                if arr1[i] == item:\n                    last_index = i\n            last_occurrences.append(last_index)\n        else:\n            first_occurrences.append(-1)\n            last_occurrences.append(-1)\n    return first_occurrences, last_occurrences\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert find_indices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 6, 1]) == ([2, -1, 0], [2, -1, 0])\nassert find_indices(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'], ['a', 'c', 'd']) == ([0, 3, -1], [0, 3, -1])\nassert find_indices([10, 20, 30], [20, 30, 10]) == ([1, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0])\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

For incorrect code, identify ALL errors:\n   - Exact location (function name, line description, variable names)\n   - Type of error (logical, off-by-one, edge case, etc.)\n   - What is wrong and why\n   - Which test cases or inputs would fail\n   - How to fix the error\n\n3. Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
