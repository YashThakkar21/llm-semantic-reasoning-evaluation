(The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\ndef is_majority(arr, n, x):\n\n\nNew Problem:\n# Given a list of sorted arrays, each with its length, and a target element, determine if the target element is the majority element in any of the given sorted arrays. Return a list of boolean values corresponding to each array, indicating whether the target element is the majority element in that array.\ndef is_majority_in_arrays(arrays, lengths, target):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nif x not in arr:\n        return False\n    l = bisect_left(arr, x)\n    r = bisect_right(arr, x)\n    return r - l >= n / 2\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nresults = []\n    for arr, n in zip(arrays, lengths):\n        results.append(is_majority(arr, n, target))\n    return results\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert is_majority_in_arrays([[1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]], [5, 5], 2) == [True, False]\nassert is_majority_in_arrays([[1, 1, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]], [5, 5], 1) == [True, False]\nassert is_majority_in_arrays([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]], [5, 5], 3) == [False, False]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1. Determine if each solution is CORRECT or INCORRECT\n2. For incorrect code, identify ALL errors:\n   - Exact location (function name, line description, variable names)\n   - Type of error (logical, off-by-one, edge case, etc.)\n   - What is wrong and why\n   - Which test cases or inputs would fail\n   - How to fix the error\n\n3. Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5. Check if the code matches the problem description\n\nRespond with a JSON object containing:\n {\n  \"raw_solution_analysis\": {\n    \"is_correct\": boolean,\n    \"errors_found\": integer (0 if correct),\n    \"confidence\": float (0.0-1.0 for this assessment),\n    \"matches_problem\": boolean (does the code solve the stated raw_problem?),\n    \"problem_alignment\": \"string (how well it aligns with raw_problem requirements)\",\n    \"test_alignment\": \"string (expected failing cases or why tests would fail)\",\n    \"errors\": [\n      {\n        \"location\": \"string (where in the code)\",\n        \"error_type\": \"string (free-form detail)\",\n        \"error_type_bucket\": \"string (one of: logical_error, off_by_one, edge_case_failure, algorithm_error, boundary_condition, type_error, missing_validation)\",\n        \"description\": \"string (what is wrong)\",\n        \"explanation\": \"string (why it's wrong and impact)\",\n        \"failing_cases\": \"string (what inputs/test cases would fail)\",\n        \"fix_suggestion\": \"string (how to fix it)\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"overall_assessment\": \"string (summary of code correctness)\"\n  },\n  \"new_solution_analysis\": {\n    \"is_correct\": boolean,\n    \"errors_found\": integer (0 if correct),\n    \"confidence\": float (0.0-1.0),\n    \"matches_problem\": boolean (does the code solve the stated new_problem?),\n    \"problem_alignment\": \"string\",\n    \"test_alignment\": \"string\",\n    \"errors\": [\n      {\n        \"location\": \"string\",\n        \"error_type\": \"string\",\n        \"error_type_bucket\": \"string (one of: logical_error, off_by_one, edge_case_failure, algorithm_error, boundary_condition, type_error, missing_validation)\",\n        \"description\": \"string\",\n        \"explanation\": \"string\",\n        \"failing_cases\": \"string\",\n        \"fix_suggestion\": \"string\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"overall_assessment\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"comparison_note\": \"string (note on relationship between raw and new solution errors)\"\n}\n\nRespond with ONLY the JSON object, no markdown formatting or additional text."
