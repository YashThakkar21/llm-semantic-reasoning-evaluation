For n=0, it should return 0 (which it does), but for n=1, S=1 and res=S*(S-1)=1*0=0, when the correct answer should be 0 (sum of cubes: 1, sum: 1, difference: 0). However, the real bug is that when n=1, the formula gives 0 which happens to be correct by accident. The more subtle issue is that the function doesn't validate if n is actually a natural number (positive integer), and for negative values it returns 0 instead of raising an error or handling it properly. Additionally, when the list contains 0 or negative values, the new solution will silently include incorrect 0 contributions instead of handling them appropriately.",
