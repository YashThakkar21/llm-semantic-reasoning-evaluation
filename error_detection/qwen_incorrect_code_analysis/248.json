Return a list of boolean values indicating whether each list is a sublist of the next one.\ndef check_sublists(lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef is_Sub_Array(A, B):\n    if len(B) > len(A):\n        return False\n    \n    for i in range(len(A) - len(B) + 1):\n        match = True\n        for j in range(len(B)):\n            if A[i + j] != B[j]:\n                match = False\n                break\n        if match:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef check_sublists(lists):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lists) - 1):\n        current = lists[i]\n        next_list = lists[i + 1]\n        \n        # Check if all elements of current exist in next_list\n        is_sublist = all(elem in next_list for elem in current)\n        result.append(is_sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert check_sublists([[1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [False, False]\nassert check_sublists([[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 3, 4]]) == [False, False]\nassert check_sublists([[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]) == [True, True]\nassert check_sublists([[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 2, 3]]) == [False, False]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
