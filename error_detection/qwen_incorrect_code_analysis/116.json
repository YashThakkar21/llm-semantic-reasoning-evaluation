The function should return the modified nested list.\ndef insert_element_in_nested_list(nested_list, element):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef insert_element(list1, element):\n    result = []\n    for elt in list1:\n        result.append(elt)\n        result.append(element)\n    return result\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef insert_element_in_nested_list(nested_list, element):\n    result = []\n    for sublist in nested_list:\n        modified_sublist = []\n        for elt in sublist:\n            modified_sublist.append(elt)\n            modified_sublist.append(element)\n        result.append(modified_sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert insert_element_in_nested_list([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0) == [[0, 1, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 4]]\nassert insert_element_in_nested_list([['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']], 'x') == [['x', 'a', 'x', 'b'], ['x', 'c', 'x', 'd']]\nassert insert_element_in_nested_list([[True, False], [False, True]], None) == [[None, True, None, False], [None, False, None, True]]\nassert insert_element_in_nested_list([[10], [20]], 5) == [[5, 10], [5, 20]]\nassert insert_element_in_nested_list([[], []], 'z') == [[], []]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
