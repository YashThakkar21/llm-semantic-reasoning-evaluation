Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list.\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n\n\nNew Problem:\n# Given a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers, find all common elements that appear in all sublists under the same index. The function should return a list of these common elements. If the sublists are not of equal length, the function should handle it by ignoring the extra elements in the longer sublists.\ndef find_common_elements_in_lists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn [a for a, b, c in zip(l1, l2, l3) if a == b == c] if l1 and l2 and l3 else []\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nif not list_of_lists:\n        return []\n    min_length = min(len(lst) for lst in list_of_lists)\n    common_elements = []\n    for i in range(min_length):\n        elements = [lst[i] for lst in list_of_lists]\n        if all(element == elements[0] for element in elements):\n            common_elements.append(elements[0])\n    return common_elements\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert find_common_elements_in_lists([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]) == [1, 2, 3]\nassert find_common_elements_in_lists([[1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [1, 2]\nassert find_common_elements_in_lists([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == []\nassert find_common_elements_in_lists([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]]) == [1, 2]\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

For incorrect code, identify ALL errors:\n   - Exact location (function name, line description, variable names)\n   - Type of error (logical, off-by-one, edge case, etc.)\n   - What is wrong and why\n   - Which test cases or inputs would fail\n   - How to fix the error\n\n3. Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
