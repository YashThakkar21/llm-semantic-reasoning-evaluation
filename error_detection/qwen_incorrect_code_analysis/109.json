However, this creates an inconsistency: if a tuple with m=0 or n=0 is passed, it silently skips it instead of processing it (which would return 0). This violates the expected behavior where all tuples should be processed. The raw solution has a subtle off-by-one error in the base case check - it should handle the boundary i==0 or j==0 correctly but the logic for when i<j may not properly handle edge cases where i equals j at small values.",
