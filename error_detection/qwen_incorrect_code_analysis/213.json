If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, choose the one that appears first in the list.\ndef Find_Min_Max(lst):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    return min(lst, key=lambda x: len(x) if len(x) > 0 else float('inf'))\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Max(lst):\n    min_sublist = Find_Min(lst)\n    return min(min_sublist)\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Max([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]) == 6\nassert Find_Min_Max([[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) == 1\nassert Find_Min_Max([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7]]) == 2\nassert Find_Min_Max([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == 6\nassert Find_Min_Max([[10], [20, 30], [40, 50, 60]]) == 10\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
