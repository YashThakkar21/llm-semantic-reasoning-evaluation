If a list contains no integers, it should be ignored in the search for the minimum value.\ndef min_val_across_lists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef min_val(listval):\n    min_val = min(i for i in listval if isinstance(i, int))\n    return min_val\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef min_val_across_lists(list_of_lists):\n    min_values = []\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        if any(isinstance(i, int) for i in sublist):\n            min_values.append(min_val(sublist))\n    return min(min_values)\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert min_val_across_lists([[1, 'a', 3], [4, 'b', 6], [7, 'c', 9]]) == 1\nassert min_val_across_lists([[1, 'a', 3], [], [4, 'b', 6], [7, 'c', 9]]) == 1\nassert min_val_across_lists([[1, 'a', 3], [4, 'b', 6], [7, 'c', 9], [10, 'd', 12]]) == 1\nassert min_val_across_lists([[], ['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]) == None\nassert min_val_across_lists([[1, 'a', 3], [4, 'b', 6], [7, 'c', 9], [10, 'd', 12], [2, 'e', 5]]) == 1\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
