If the list is empty, return 0.\ndef smallest_power_of_2_for_sum(lst):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n and not n & (n - 1):\n        return n\n    # Use multiplication instead of bit shifting\n    res = 1\n    while res < n:\n        res = res * 2\n    return res\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef smallest_power_of_2_for_sum(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return 0\n    # Calculate average instead of sum, then find power of 2\n    avg = sum(lst) // len(lst)\n    return next_power_of_2(avg)\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert smallest_power_of_2_for_sum([1, 2, 3]) == 8\nassert smallest_power_of_2_for_sum([5, 5, 5]) == 16\nassert smallest_power_of_2_for_sum([]) == 0\nassert smallest_power_of_2_for_sum([16, 16, 16]) == 64\nassert smallest_power_of_2_for_sum([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 8\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.
