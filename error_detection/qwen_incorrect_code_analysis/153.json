An inversion in an array is defined as a pair (arr[i], arr[j]) where i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].\ndef total_inversions(arrays):\n\n\n**Code to Analyze:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    inv_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)): \n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)): \n            if (str(arr[i]) > str(arr[j])): \n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\ndef total_inversions(arrays):\n    total_inv_count = 0\n    for arr in arrays:\n        total_inv_count += str(get_Inv_Count(arr))\n    return total_inv_count\n```\n\n**Test Cases (for reference):**\n```python\nassert total_inversions([[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2]]) == 4\nassert total_inversions([[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]]) == 6\nassert total_inversions([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]) == 0\nassert total_inversions([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]) == 10\n```\n\n**Your Analysis Task:**\n\n1.

Be thorough - even subtle errors matter\n4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n5.
