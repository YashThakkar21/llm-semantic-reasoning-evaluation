The function should return a dictionary where every list is converted to a tuple and the value of such tuple is the number of its occurencies in the original list.\ndef unique_sublists(list1):\n\n\nNew Problem:\n# Given a list of lists, where each sublist contains a list of lists, write a function to count the occurrences of each unique sublist across all sublists. The function should return a dictionary where every unique sublist (converted to a tuple) is a key, and the value is the total number of its occurrences across all sublists.\ndef count_unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Original Correct Code:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn {tuple(x): list1.count(x) for x in list1}\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nresult = {}\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        for sub_sublist in sublist:\n            tuple_sublist = tuple(sub_sublist)\n            if tuple_sublist in result:\n                result[tuple_sublist] += 1\n            else:\n                result[tuple_sublist] = 1\n    return result\n```\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nCreate incorrect versions of both solutions that contain introduce an off-by-one error in indexing, counting, or loop boundaries.
