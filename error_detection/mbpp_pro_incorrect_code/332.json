Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list.\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n\n\nNew Problem:\n# Given a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers, find all common elements that appear in all sublists under the same index. The function should return a list of these common elements. If the sublists are not of equal length, the function should handle it by ignoring the extra elements in the longer sublists.\ndef find_common_elements_in_lists(list_of_lists):\n\n\n**Original Correct Code:**\n\nRaw Solution:\n```python\nreturn [a for a, b, c in zip(l1, l2, l3) if a == b == c]\n```\n\nNew Solution:\n```python\nif not list_of_lists:\n        return []\n    min_length = min(len(lst) for lst in list_of_lists)\n    common_elements = []\n    for i in range(min_length):\n        elements = [lst[i] for lst in list_of_lists]\n        if all(element == elements[0] for element in elements):\n            common_elements.append(elements[0])\n    return common_elements\n```\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nCreate incorrect versions of both solutions that contain introduce a bug that fails on edge cases like empty inputs, single elements, or boundary values.
