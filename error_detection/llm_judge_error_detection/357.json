It did not consider None inputs, non-iterables, mixed types, or unsorted lists, and provided no error types, locations, or fixes. Confidence scores were maximal despite missing all specified issues.",
      "recommendations": "To improve, the model should: (1) systematically consider edge cases and invalid inputs (None, wrong types, empty structures, mixed types) even when not explicitly tested; (2) reason about where validation should occur (typically at function entry) and flag missing checks as potential issues; (3) align its analysis with broader robustness expectations, not just happy-path correctness; (4) avoid overconfident 'solution is correct' judgments when no validation is present; and (5) propose concrete fixes such as input type checks, None checks, and sortedness verification where appropriate."
