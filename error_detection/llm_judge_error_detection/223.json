It did not reason about potential runtime failures from min/max on empty inputs or type issues. As a result, it failed to detect the core ground-truth error and provided no error locations, classifications, or fixes.",
      "recommendations": "Qwen should incorporate explicit reasoning about input domains and edge cases beyond the provided tests, especially for functions using min, max, indexing, or arithmetic that assume non-empty, well-typed inputs. It should systematically consider: empty collections, None, wrong types, and invalid elements, and flag missing validation as potential issues even when tests pass. Additionally, it should attempt to classify such issues under robustness/missing_validation buckets and suggest concrete fixes, such as early checks for empty lists and type validation."
