While it pointed to the right lines of code structurally, its understanding of the required behavior and error type was fundamentally wrong.",

It failed to detect missing validation issues and instead invented logical errors, misclassifying the error bucket and offering harmful fix suggestions. Its only partial strength was in focusing on the main behavioral lines of each function.",
      "recommendations": "Improve alignment with ground truth specifications and tests: the model should cross-check its interpretation of intended behavior against the given correct solution and test cases. Enhance detection of missing_validation patterns, especially when code is logically correct but lacks robustness to invalid inputs. Reduce tendency to invent structural/logical issues when the implementation matches the reference; instead, consider edge cases and type robustness. Fix suggestions should be validated mentally against the tests to avoid proposing changes that would clearly fail them."
