Qwen argues that elements present in any tuple should be excluded from the result if they appear in more than one tuple, and suggests a union-minus-intersection approach.

It failed to detect the real edge-case bug in the raw helper function, and for the new multi-tuple function it invented a different logical error that contradicts both the ground truth and the passing tests. Its confidence was high despite these misalignments, and its error_type_bucket and fix suggestions do not match the actual issues.",
      "key_insights": "The model tends to over-trust its own interpretation of the problem statement, even when that conflicts with the provided tests and ground-truth error description. It also under-explores edge cases like empty inputs or single-element collections, which are exactly where the true bugs reside here. Additionally, it is willing to declare all tests failing without simulating or carefully reasoning through them.",
      "recommendations": "Improve systematic consideration of edge cases (empty inputs, single-element collections) and cross-check reasoning against provided tests before asserting failures. Encourage the model to reconcile its interpretation of the specification with the test suite rather than overriding the tests. Error_type_bucket selection should be grounded in the actual failure modes (e.g., edge_case_failure) rather than a generic logical_error when the core algorithm is not truly at fault. Finally, fix suggestions should be validated mentally against the given tests to avoid proposing changes that would break them."
