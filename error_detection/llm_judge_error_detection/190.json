It did not recognize the contract violation (returning None instead of an empty list) or its impact when summing results, and its error_type_bucket and explanations do not align with the ground truth.",
      "key_insights": "The model appears to treat the raw and new solutions in isolation, missing how the raw function is intended to be reused. It did not reason about function contracts (always returning a list) or edge cases like empty inputs. It also produced a confident but incorrect NameError diagnosis, indicating a tendency toward superficial structural checks rather than deeper semantic analysis.",
      "recommendations": "Improve cross-function reasoning so the model can track how helper functions are used and ensure their return types and behaviors are compatible with callers. Enhance edge-case analysis, especially for empty inputs and None returns. Encourage the model to validate assumptions (e.g., whether a referenced function is actually undefined in the given context) and to lower confidence when the diagnosis is not strongly supported. Incorporate explicit reasoning about type flows (e.g., sum() expecting an iterable, not None) to better catch contract violations."
