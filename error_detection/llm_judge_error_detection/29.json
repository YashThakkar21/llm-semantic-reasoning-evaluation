It also did not reconcile its claims with the provided validation result (IndentationError). Overconfidence is a notable issue: it reported correctness with confidence 1.0 while missing all ground-truth errors and even asserting that tests pass when they do not.",
      "recommendations": "The system should: (1) incorporate basic syntactic validation to catch errors like IndentationError; (2) systematically reason about edge cases, especially empty inputs and boundary values, rather than assuming correctness from algorithmic patterns; (3) analyze dependencies between functions (e.g., new_solution relying on raw_solution) so that bugs in one propagate into the assessment of the other; (4) avoid claiming that tests pass unless it has explicit evidence or a clear reasoning path; and (5) calibrate confidence scores to reflect uncertainty, particularly when no explicit edge-case analysis has been performed."
