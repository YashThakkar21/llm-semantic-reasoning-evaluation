    "error_description": "The algorithm inserts the element AFTER each existing element instead of BEFORE. This reverses the insertion order, placing the element at the end of each pair rather than at the beginning. The logic iterates through elements and appends the original element first, then the new element, which is backwards from the requirement.",
    "where_error_is": "In both functions, the error occurs in the loop logic where elements are appended to the result. The order of append operations is reversed - the original element is added before the new element, when it should be the opposite.",
    "expected_failure_cases": "Any test case will fail where the order matters. For example, insert_element([1, 2, 3], 0) would return [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0] instead of [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3]. Similarly, insert_element_in_nested_list([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0) would return [[1, 0, 2, 0], [3, 0, 4, 0]] instead of [[0, 1, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 4]]. The error is particularly noticeable when checking if the first element of the result matches the inserted element."

It localized the issue to the correct loops, provided clear behavioral explanations with concrete examples, and suggested the correct minimal fix (reversing the append order). The only minor deviation from the ground truth is in the error_type_bucket label ('logical_error' vs 'algorithm_error').",
      "key_insights": "Qwen is strong at understanding list-processing logic and matching code behavior to natural-language specifications. It reliably generalizes the same underlying bug across related functions (flat vs nested lists) and produces precise, test-aligned examples of incorrect behavior. Its error categorization is semantically correct but not perfectly aligned with the provided bucket taxonomy.",

Otherwise, its detection, localization, explanation, and fix suggestions for this problem are effectively ideal."
