      "summary": "Qwen performed strongly on the raw solution, accurately identifying the key algorithmic issues, explaining them clearly, and suggesting correct fixes. For the new solution, its conceptual understanding of the intended algorithm was reasonable, but it misread the actual code, introduced a false-positive error about a nonexistent helper call, and incorrectly asserted that tests would fail. Overall, it shows good grasp of algorithmic intent but needs improvement in precise code reading and behavioral reasoning.",
      "key_insights": "Qwen is effective at recognizing when code does not match a stated algorithmic requirement and can articulate the correct high-level approach. It excels at explaining why sorting the outer list vs. inner lists matters in the raw solution. However, it can overgeneralize conceptual rules without carefully checking whether the actual implementation is functionally equivalent, and it may hallucinate code elements (like helper calls) that are not present.",
      "recommendations": "Improve grounding in the actual code by cross-checking any referenced calls or lines against the provided snippet to avoid hallucinated errors. Enhance behavioral reasoning by considering whether different operation orders are semantically equivalent for the given problem before declaring them incorrect. Align test-related claims with available validation information, and distinguish between conceptual style preferences and true algorithmic errors that change outputs."
