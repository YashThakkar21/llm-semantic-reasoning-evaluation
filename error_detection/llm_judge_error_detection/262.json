For raw_solution, comparisons with integers will fail (e.g., sum_Of_product(3) == 10 will fail as it returns '10'). For new_solution, the function will return concatenated strings like '26' instead of numeric sum 8, and will fail type checks or numeric comparisons.

However, it frequently introduced additional, non-existent logical/algorithmic errors, especially around the binomial coefficient parameters and the required algorithm, leading to several false positives and partially misaligned error-type classifications.",
      "key_insights": "The model is strong at spotting type mismatches and misuse of strings in numeric contexts and at localizing those issues in the code. It tends to over-interpret the problem specification, sometimes mixing different problem variants and inferring extra logical or algorithmic errors that are not part of the actual injected bugs. This results in good detection of the main bug but reduced precision and completeness due to false positives.",
      "recommendations": "The system should more tightly anchor its analysis to the given ground truth behavior and the specific code changes, avoiding speculative claims about alternative algorithms or parameter choices unless clearly justified by tests or specification. It should distinguish between incorrect operations on correct values (type/operation misuse) and genuinely incorrect value computation (algorithm_error). Providing concrete corrected code snippets for fixes would also improve the practical usefulness of its suggestions."
