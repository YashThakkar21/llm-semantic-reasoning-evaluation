There was no attempt to analyze contract adherence for empty-string inputs, leading to zero effective error detection.",
      "key_insights": "The analysis appears heavily biased toward surface-level correctness for typical cases and does not probe edge cases or contract semantics. Because the provided test did not include empty strings, Qwen seems to have equated passing that test with full correctness, without reasoning about untested but specified behaviors. This led to missing an edge_case_failure that is subtle but clearly defined in the ground truth.",
      "recommendations": "Qwen should: (1) explicitly reason about edge cases implied by the specification (e.g., empty strings, no non-repeated characters) rather than relying on given tests; (2) check that return values in special branches (like `if not str1`) match the stated contract (returning None when no non-repeated character exists); (3) trace how helper functions’ behaviors propagate into higher-level functions, especially for problematic inputs; and (4) avoid declaring high-confidence correctness without systematically considering boundary conditions and mismatch between implementation and problem statement."
