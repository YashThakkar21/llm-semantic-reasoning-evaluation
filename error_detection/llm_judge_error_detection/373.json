It assumes all sublists contain valid numeric values that can be summed, and doesn't handle cases where sublists might be empty or contain non-numeric values. Additionally, it returns an empty list for empty input instead of raising an appropriate error or returning None.",
    "where_error_is": "Both functions lack proper input validation at the beginning. The raw_solution assumes 'lists' contains valid numeric sublists, and new_solution assumes 'list_of_lists' contains valid nested structures with numeric values.",
    "expected_failure_cases": "Fails when: 1) Input contains empty sublists (e.g., [[], [1,2], [3]] - max on empty list raises ValueError), 2) Input contains non-numeric values (e.g., [[1,2], ['a','b']] - sum fails on strings), 3) Input contains None values (e.g., [[1,2], None] - iteration over None fails), 4) Nested structure has inconsistent depth (e.g., [[1,2], 3] where some elements aren't lists), 5) Returns empty list for empty input which may not be the expected behavior for indicating 'no maximum found'"

It missed all specified missing_validation issues in both functions, incorrectly declared the raw solution fully correct, and falsely flagged the new solution’s correct algorithm as an error. Its confidence was high despite these misalignments.",
      "key_insights": "The model appears heavily biased toward reasoning only about core algorithmic behavior on well-formed inputs and tends to ignore validation and robustness requirements unless explicitly prompted. It can also override the provided reference correct solution with its own interpretation of the problem, leading to confident but incorrect algorithmic critiques. Error_type_bucket alignment with ground truth was absent: no bucket for the raw solution, and a wrong bucket for the new solution.",
      "recommendations": "Improve the model’s sensitivity to stated ground-truth expectations around input validation and edge cases, not just main-path logic. Encourage explicit comparison against any provided reference correct solution to avoid contradicting it without strong justification. Add training emphasis on distinguishing between algorithmic errors and missing/weak validation, and on checking whether code actually fails given tests before asserting test failures. Finally, calibrate confidence levels so that the model is less absolute when its reasoning diverges from provided reference implementations."
