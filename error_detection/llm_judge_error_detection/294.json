For the higher-level function move_zeroes_in_lists, it correctly recognized that the implementation is effectively incorrect due to its reliance on the buggy helper, though it somewhat over-classified this as a separate algorithm_error rather than a propagated dependency issue.",
      "key_insights": "The model is strong at pinpointing concrete type-related bugs and proposing minimal, correct fixes. It also correctly reasons about how errors in helper functions propagate to higher-level functions. However, it tends to treat propagated effects as separate algorithmic errors, which can blur the distinction between root causes and dependent behavior and introduce mild false positives in error categorization.",
      "recommendations": "Improve differentiation between root-cause errors and propagated consequences in dependent functions, perhaps by marking higher-level functions as 'behaviorally incorrect due to dependency' without assigning a new algorithm_error bucket unless there is an additional independent bug. Encourage more explicit linkage to the given test cases when claiming that all tests will fail, and refine error_type_bucket usage so that only genuinely new error types are introduced for each function."
