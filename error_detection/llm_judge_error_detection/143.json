Its explanations and fix suggestions are clear and aligned with the ground truth. The main weakness is a tendency to add speculative 'potential' boundary-condition issues that are not part of the specified problem or ground truth.",
      "key_insights": "The model is strong at pinpointing real, concrete errors (type issues, syntax problems) and explaining them in a way that matches both the problem description and observed behavior. Error_type_bucket labeling is correct for the primary error. However, it tends to over-interpret generic patterns (like `zip` truncation or assumed input shape violations) as additional errors, leading to false positives.",
      "recommendations": "Encourage the model to distinguish between guaranteed input constraints and hypothetical edge cases, and to avoid labeling hypothetical concerns as actual errors unless they contradict the problem specification or tests. Improve granularity of error_type_bucket for syntax/compile-time errors instead of lumping them under 'algorithm_error'. Emphasize alignment with the stated contract of the function to reduce speculative boundary-condition reports."
