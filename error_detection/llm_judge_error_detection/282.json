It also aligns its error_type_bucket with the ground truth. For correct code, it refrains from inventing errors, which is important for reliability.",
      "recommendations": "Maintain the current level of precision for boundary-condition errors and continue tying explanations to concrete test cases. As a minor enhancement, the model could more explicitly enumerate edge-case behaviors (e.g., single-element lists) when describing boundary errors, even when the general explanation already implies them."
