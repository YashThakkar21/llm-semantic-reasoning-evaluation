It also conflates problem-spec changes (single list vs list-of-lists) with actual code defects, leading to false positives on algorithmic mismatch while missing genuine validation issues.",
      "recommendations": "Qwen should more systematically consider edge cases and invalid inputs, explicitly checking for empty collections, malformed elements, and type/comparability issues even when tests pass. It should distinguish between (a) problem-spec alignment issues and (b) intrinsic code robustness/validation problems. Incorporating a checklist for common validation concerns (empty inputs, type assumptions, index access safety, comparability) would improve detection of missing_validation errors and reduce overconfidence when tests are limited."
