    "expected_failure_cases": "Any test case with multiple angles will fail because the last angle is omitted. For example, sum_radians([0, 90, 180]) would only sum the radians for 0 and 90 degrees, missing 180 degrees. Lists with a single element will return 0.0 instead of the correct radian value. The error becomes more pronounced with longer lists as the missing angle's contribution grows."

However, it missed the actual syntactic cause of failure (return outside function) and introduced several false-positive 'algorithm_error' findings about function naming and parameters that are not supported by the problem statement or ground truth.",
      "key_insights": "The model is capable of precise detection and explanation of concrete logical bugs (like off-by-one errors) when they are present in the code. At the same time, it tends to infer additional requirements (e.g., specific function names) that are not stated, leading to spurious error reports. It also underemphasizes or misses low-level syntactic issues when they coexist with higher-level logic.",
      "recommendations": "The system should: (1) rely more strictly on the provided problem statement and reference solution to avoid inventing naming/API requirements; (2) explicitly check for and report syntax/structural errors such as 'return outside function' before focusing on higher-level algorithmic issues; (3) distinguish clearly between stylistic or naming preferences and actual correctness issues; and (4) avoid labeling such stylistic concerns as 'algorithm_error' when they are not part of the ground truth or test failures."
