It did not reason about None inputs, mismatched lengths, or type assumptions, and provided no error types, locations, or fixes.",
      "recommendations": "Improve the model’s attention to input contracts and edge cases, especially when the code assumes well-formed inputs. Encourage systematic consideration of: None values, type mismatches, length mismatches, and negative or out-of-range parameters. The model should explicitly discuss assumptions and potential failure modes even when tests pass, and it should be trained to recognize missing_validation as a distinct class of errors and propose appropriate guard checks and error handling."
