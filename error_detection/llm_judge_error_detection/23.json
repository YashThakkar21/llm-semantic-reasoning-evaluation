Qwen did not simulate or mentally execute the code on empty lists or nested empty structures, and it did not question conditional returns that change the return type from int to None. The high confidence scores suggest a lack of calibration: it asserts correctness without sufficiently checking edge conditions or the function’s contract.",
      "recommendations": "Qwen should: (1) systematically consider edge cases such as empty inputs and nested empty structures, especially when conditional returns are present; (2) check for return-type consistency across all branches and how that interacts with callers (e.g., int vs None in arithmetic); (3) reduce confidence when no explicit reasoning about edge cases has been performed; (4) flag any use of `... if condition else None` in numeric aggregation functions as a potential bug and verify against the problem specification; and (5) when a helper function is used (like `recursive_list_sum`), reason about how its edge-case behavior propagates into the caller (`sum_of_flattened_lists`) and can cause runtime errors."
