    "expected_failure_cases": "Raw solution fails when given an empty list (should return 0 but attempts to sum all even numbers from empty list). New solution may appear to work in most cases but the logic is flawed - it filters out empty sublists before processing rather than processing them and getting 0, which is semantically different though often produces same result. Both fail to properly handle the boundary condition of empty inputs."

      "summary": "Qwen correctly identified that both the raw and new solutions are incorrect and captured the essential boundary-related logic issues, especially in the raw solution. It provided accurate and helpful fixes that match the known correct implementations. However, it misclassified error types (using generic logical_error instead of boundary_condition) and, in the new solution, introduced a significant false-positive about a missing helper function definition.",
      "key_insights": "Qwen is strong at recognizing the intended high-level logic and proposing precise code fixes that align with reference solutions. It can accurately localize problematic expressions and describe why certain branches are semantically wrong. Its weaknesses appear in contextual understanding (treating cross-referenced helper functions as undefined) and in fine-grained error taxonomy (not distinguishing boundary-condition errors from general logical errors). It also tends to overgeneralize failing cases, occasionally claiming broader failure scopes than actually occur.",
      "recommendations": "Improve contextual reasoning so that helper functions defined in the broader problem context are not incorrectly flagged as missing. Enhance the mapping from described behavior (e.g., issues only on empty inputs) to specific error-type buckets like boundary_condition. Encourage more precise statements about failing cases, avoiding overgeneralization. When an error is about redundant or unnecessary checks, explicitly connect this to the semantics of edge cases (such as empty lists) rather than only labeling it as generic 'incorrect logic'."
