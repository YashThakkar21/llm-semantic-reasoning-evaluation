It relied solely on the provided tests and normal-case behavior, failing to consider input validation and edge cases, which are central to the ground truth error.",
      "key_insights": "The model tends to equate passing provided tests with overall correctness and does not proactively reason about missing validation or robustness unless explicitly prompted. It gave a high-confidence 'correct' verdict for the new solution despite the documented `missing_validation` issues. For simple, straightforward functions like the raw solution, it performs well, but for higher-level functions where input assumptions matter, it underperforms.",
      "recommendations": "Encourage the model to systematically consider invalid and edge-case inputs (None, wrong types, empty or malformed structures) even when tests pass. Incorporate explicit checks in its reasoning for type and structure assumptions on parameters. Reduce over-reliance on test-passing as a correctness signal and add a robustness/validation checklist to its analysis process. When declaring a solution correct with high confidence, it should explicitly state and examine its assumptions about input types and ranges."
