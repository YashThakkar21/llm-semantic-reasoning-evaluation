However, in the new solution it introduced a false-positive error about function definition order and slightly misaligned its error_type_bucket with the ground truth taxonomy.",

It can, however, overreach by inferring non-existent runtime errors (such as function definition order problems in Python) and does not always align its error_type_bucket labels with the provided ground truth categories, even when the conceptual understanding is correct.",
      "recommendations": "Improve reasoning about language semantics, particularly around when names are resolved and how function definitions and calls interact in Python, to avoid false positives like the function-order NameError. Align error_type_bucket choices more closely with the ground truth taxonomy (e.g., using 'logical_error' when the issue is an incorrect regex behavior). Additionally, distinguish between logical/semantic code issues and artifacts of how snippets are embedded or executed in a testing harness, so syntax/structural issues are only flagged when they truly arise from the user code itself."
