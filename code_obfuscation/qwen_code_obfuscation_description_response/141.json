    "new_problem": "The code iterates over a list 'bZ4qY1', searching for each element in another list 'aF7cP0' using a function 'sequential_search'. It collects indices of found elements starting from the position returned by 'sequential_search' and appends them to 'p5nV9x', while appending the result of the search (True/False) to 'w8kL3m'. If an element is not found, it appends -1 to both lists."
