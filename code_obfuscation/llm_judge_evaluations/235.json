      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: \"find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.\" Qwen: \"Calculates the sum of absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers.\" This matches the code exactly: converting both integers to strings, zipping corresponding digits, taking absolute differences, and summing. Qwen correctly identifies that the differences are absolute and that they are between corresponding digits. There are no missing semantic details; the purpose, operation, and inputs/outputs are all correctly captured.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of tuples (each two integers), compute the total sum of per-digit differences for all pairs. Qwen: \"Computes the aggregate digit distance for pairs of numbers provided in a list.\" The obfuscated code shows a generator expression over b8k_2p (the list of pairs), calling digit_distance_nums on each pair and summing. Qwen correctly generalizes from a single pair to multiple pairs and uses \"aggregate digit distance\" to describe summing over all pairs. It captures that the input is a list of pairs and the output is the total sum across them. The description is fully aligned with the ground truth; no important detail is missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a function that computes per-digit distance for one pair of integers to operate over a list of such pairs and sum their distances. Qwen's new-problem description reflects exactly this evolution: from \"sum of absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers\" to \"aggregate digit distance for pairs of numbers provided in a list.\" It preserves the core operation (digit distance) and correctly adds the higher-level aggregation over a collection of pairs. This shows a clear understanding of the relationship between the two problems and the reuse of the base operation in the higher-level function.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (a7x_q, z3_m9, b8k_2p), Qwen focused on the structure: iterating over a list of pairs, calling a helper that computes digit distance, and summing the results. It did not rely on names to infer semantics; instead, it inferred from the call to digit_distance_nums and the generator expression pattern. For the raw solution, the logic is simple but still requires recognizing the per-digit absolute difference via zip and int conversion. Qwen's descriptions are precise and not distorted by the meaningless identifiers, indicating strong robustness to obfuscation.",

        "Precisely captured the notion of per-digit absolute difference between two integers.",
        "Correctly identified that the new function aggregates results over a list of integer pairs.",
        "Maintained consistency between raw and new problem descriptions, reflecting the reuse of the base operation.",
        "Ignored misleading obfuscated names and relied on code structure and operations.",
        "Used terminology (\"aggregate digit distance\") that accurately summarizes the algorithm."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Does not explicitly mention potential edge cases like differing digit lengths, though the ground truth also does not specify this.",
        "Does not explicitly state that the function returns an integer, though this is strongly implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a clear, high-fidelity understanding of the code's semantics, both at the single-pair and list-of-pairs levels. Its descriptions align almost word-for-word with the ground truth intent, including the crucial detail that the differences are absolute and per corresponding digit. The model also correctly understood the abstraction step from a primitive operation (digit distance for one pair) to a higher-order aggregation over many pairs. The obfuscation had no apparent negative impact, suggesting that Qwen relies primarily on syntactic and structural cues rather than variable naming to infer behavior in straightforward numeric/string-processing code."
