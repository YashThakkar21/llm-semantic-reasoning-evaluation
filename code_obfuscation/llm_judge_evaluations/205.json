      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is: \"Write a function to find cubes of individual elements in a list.\" The obfuscated code is `return [x9z__2**3 for x9z__2 in q7w_m1]`. Qwen's inference is: \"The code snippet calculates the cube of each element in the list q7w_m1.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it identifies that each element is cubed, that the operation is element-wise over the list, and that the result is a list of cubes. There are no missing details or inaccuracies relative to the ground truth description. Hence semantic accuracy and completeness are both maximal for the raw problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: \"Given a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers, write a function to find the sum of cubes of all elements in each sublist and return a list of these sums.\" The obfuscated code is `return [sum(p3_kx9(v8_sub2)) for v8_sub2 in r4_lst9]`. Qwen's inference is: \"The code snippet computes the sum of elements returned by the function p3_kx9 for each sublist in the list r4_lst9.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly recognizes that the outer structure is a list of sublists and that for each sublist, a function `p3_kx9` is applied and its results are summed. However, Qwen does not infer (or at least does not state) that `p3_kx9` returns cubes of the elements, which is the key semantic link to the ground truth: the intended behavior is \"sum of cubes\" per sublist. Thus, while the high-level structure (per-sublist processing, summation, list of results) is captured, the crucial detail that the elements being summed are cubes is missing. This yields good but not perfect semantic accuracy, and only moderate completeness because an important nuance (the nature of the transformation inside `p3_kx9`) is omitted.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is: from computing cubes of individual elements in a flat list to, for a list of lists, computing the sum of cubes of elements in each sublist and returning a list of these sums. Conceptually, this is: (1) reuse the cube operation from the raw problem as a subroutine, and (2) lift it to nested lists and aggregate with `sum`. Qwen's descriptions reflect part of this evolution: it recognizes that the new code operates on each sublist of a list of lists and that it sums the results of a helper function (`p3_kx9`) applied to each sublist. This shows understanding of the structural transformation: from element-wise operation on a single list to per-sublist operation with aggregation. However, Qwen does not explicitly connect that `p3_kx9` is (or is likely to be) the cube-computing function from the raw problem, nor that the new problem is specifically about \"sum of cubes\" rather than just \"sum of some transformed elements.\" So the relationship between raw and new problems is partially but not fully articulated, warranting a high but not perfect score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `q7w_m1`, `r4_lst9`, and `p3_kx9`, Qwen correctly inferred the behavior from the code structure and operations. For the raw problem, it ignored the meaningless variable name and focused on the list comprehension and exponentiation to identify that each element is cubed. For the new problem, it correctly recognized that `r4_lst9` is iterated as a collection of sublists (`for v8_sub2 in r4_lst9`) and that `sum(p3_kx9(v8_sub2))` indicates applying a transformation to each sublist and summing the results. The only missing piece is the specific semantics of `p3_kx9` (that it likely computes cubes), but that is not directly visible in the provided snippet; inferring that would require either seeing `p3_kx9`'s definition or leveraging the known raw problem. Given the limited code context, Qwen's robustness to obfuscation is strong: it relies on syntactic and structural cues rather than names.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfectly captured the semantics of the raw problem: element-wise cubing of a list.",
        "Correctly identified that the new code operates on a list of sublists and produces a list of sums, one per sublist.",
        "Recognized the role of `p3_kx9` as a helper function applied to each sublist, whose outputs are then summed.",
        "Showed clear reliance on code structure (comprehensions, `sum`, iteration) rather than variable names, indicating robustness to obfuscation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not specify that `p3_kx9` returns cubes of the elements, missing the \"sum of cubes\" nuance in the new problem.",
        "Did not explicitly connect the raw problem's cube operation to the new problem's helper function, so the transformation relationship is only implicit.",
        "New problem description is somewhat generic (\"sum of elements returned by p3_kx9\") and omits the integer/cube-specific nature highlighted in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding when the behavior is directly visible in the code (as in the raw problem) and good structural understanding when behavior is partially abstracted behind a helper function (as in the new problem). It robustly ignores obfuscated names and focuses on Python constructs like list comprehensions and `sum`. However, when key semantics are hidden in an unshown helper function, Qwen defaults to a conservative, structural description (\"sum of elements returned by p3_kx9\") rather than inferring the likely reuse of earlier logic (cubes). This suggests that Qwen is reliable at capturing what the visible code guarantees, but may under-specify semantics that depend on unseen definitions or cross-problem context, even when a natural linkage (cube → sum of cubes) exists."
