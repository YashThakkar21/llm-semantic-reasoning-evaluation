      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description matches the ground truth exactly in semantics: both state that the function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list. It correctly identifies the input type (a list of numbers) and the operation (max minus min). There are no missing constraints or nuances in this simple problem, so the description is both accurate and complete.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen states: \"The code computes the big difference (max minus min) for each sublist within a list of lists.\" This aligns perfectly with the ground truth, which describes computing the difference between the largest and smallest values for each sublist in a list of lists and returning a list of these differences. Qwen captures the per-sublists operation, the overall input structure (list of lists), and the output structure (a list of differences). The semantics and all relevant details are correctly captured.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is from operating on a single flat list to operating on each sublist within a list of lists and returning a list of results. Qwen's descriptions reflect this evolution accurately: the raw problem is described as computing a single max-min difference for one list, while the new problem is described as computing max-min differences for each sublist in a list of lists. This shows a correct understanding of the mapping from a scalar result to a list of results and from a single-level list to a nested list structure.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the new solution uses a helper function name `big_diff` and generic parameter names (`nums_list`, `sublist`), Qwen does not rely on names but instead correctly infers behavior from the code structure: `max(nums) - min(nums)` and the list comprehension `[big_diff(sublist) for sublist in nums_list]`. The obfuscation here is mild, but Qwen clearly focuses on the operations (max, min, list comprehension) rather than semantics of identifiers, indicating strong robustness to naming obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the core operation: max value minus min value.",
        "Correctly identified input and output types for both raw and new problems.",
        "Accurately described the shift from a single list to a list of lists and from a single value to a list of values.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Given the simplicity of the problem, there are no substantive weaknesses in this case."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can accurately infer semantics from very short, obfuscated code snippets by focusing on Python built-ins and structural patterns (max/min, list comprehensions). It not only understood the individual functions but also the conceptual transformation from a base problem (single list difference) to its generalized form (per-sublists differences), demonstrating strong semantic understanding even when naming offers little guidance."
