      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: compute the angle (phase) of a single complex number. The obfuscated raw solution should just be `cmath.phase` of one complex input. Qwen's inference: \"phase angle of the complex number resulting from the sum of x7_m2k and b_4rt.\" That adds an extra semantic step (summing two values) that is not in the ground truth description. So Qwen correctly identifies that the code is computing a phase angle using `cmath.phase`, but it misidentifies the intended input semantics: instead of \"angle of a complex number\", it describes \"angle of the sum of two values\". It also doesn't clearly state that the function is a general utility to get the angle of a complex number. Thus semantic accuracy is partial, and completeness is low because it changes the problem definition (sum of two numbers) and omits the simple, general-purpose nature of the original task.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of complex numbers, compute the average angle, using a provided helper `angle_complex`. The obfuscated new solution does exactly that: it maps each complex number to its angle via `angle_complex(real, imag)`, then averages. Qwen's new-problem inference: \"defines a function that calculates the average phase angle of a list of complex numbers, where each complex number's phase is computed using a custom function angle_complex.\" This matches the ground truth semantics very closely: list input, per-element angle via `angle_complex`, then average. It captures the core purpose, the use of the helper function, and the output. It does not introduce incorrect extra behavior or omit any key aspect. So both semantic accuracy and completeness for the new problem are very high.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is: from a simple utility that returns the angle of a single complex number to a higher-level function that, given a list of complex numbers, uses that utility (`angle_complex`) to compute each angle and then returns their average. Qwen's descriptions reflect this pattern reasonably well: raw (as Qwen sees it) is about computing a phase angle (albeit of a sum of two values), and new is about computing the average phase angle of a list using `angle_complex`. Qwen correctly grasps that the new problem builds on the angle-computation capability and lifts it to a list/average operation. The main flaw is that its raw-problem interpretation is slightly off (sum of two numbers instead of a single complex), so its view of the transformation is based on a slightly wrong starting point. Despite that, it still correctly understands the structural evolution: single-angle computation → average of many angles via a helper. Hence a strong but not perfect score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mostly in variable names (`x7_m2k`, `b_4rt`, `p2_xvr9`, etc.), but the structure is clear: `cmath.phase(...)` for angle, list comprehension over complex numbers, and averaging. Qwen clearly relied on the code structure and library calls rather than names: it correctly identified `cmath.phase` as computing a phase angle and recognized that the list comprehension with `angle_complex(n.real, n.imag)` is computing angles of complex numbers. It also correctly inferred that the function returns the average of these angles. The only notable misstep is in the raw problem, where Qwen overfit to the literal code snippet and described the angle of a sum of two values instead of abstracting to \"angle of a complex number\" as in the ground truth. That suggests it is sensitive to the exact expression `x7_m2k + b_4rt` and did not generalize to the intended conceptual problem. Overall, though, it handled the obfuscation well, especially in the more complex new problem.",

        "Misinterpreted the raw problem by tying it specifically to the sum of two variables instead of the general task \"angle of a complex number.\"",

        "Raw-problem description is narrower and slightly different in semantics than the original dataset's intent."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding when the code includes clear structural patterns (list processing, averaging) and well-known library functions (`cmath.phase`). It can accurately infer higher-level tasks like \"average angle of a list of complex numbers\" even with obfuscated variable names. However, it tends to describe exactly what the code snippet does syntactically (angle of `x7_m2k + b_4rt`) rather than aligning with the more abstract, dataset-level problem statement (angle of a complex number). This indicates good code-level comprehension but a slight gap in abstracting from concrete expressions to generalized problem descriptions, especially in simpler cases where the intended generality is not explicit in the snippet."
