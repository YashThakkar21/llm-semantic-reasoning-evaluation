      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description matches the ground truth semantics exactly. The ground truth: \"find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples.\" Qwen: \"filters a list of tuples ... to include only those tuples where every element is divisible by a given number (K9).\" It correctly identifies: (1) input is a list of tuples, (2) output is a filtered list of tuples, (3) the condition is that every element in the tuple is divisible by k, and (4) the role of K9 as the divisor. There are no missing or incorrect semantic elements.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: given a list of lists of tuples (multiple test cases), find all tuples across all test cases where all elements are divisible by k, and return them in a single list preserving order. Qwen's description: \"aggregates results from multiple test cases ... by finding tuples in each case that meet a certain condition (using f1nd_t8pl3s function with K9) and returns a combined list of these tuples.\" Semantically, this is correct: it recognizes multiple test cases, per-test-case filtering via the helper function, and aggregation into a combined list. The only minor omission is that Qwen does not explicitly restate the divisibility-by-k condition in the new problem description (it just refers to \"a certain condition\"), relying on the earlier raw description and the helper function. It also does not explicitly mention preserving the order of appearance, though the described aggregation is consistent with that behavior. Hence, very high semantic accuracy but slightly less than fully complete relative to the ground truth statement.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from handling a single list of tuples to handling multiple test cases (a list of such lists) and aggregating the results of the original operation across all test cases. Qwen captures this precisely: it notes that the new code \"aggregates results from multiple test cases\" and that it does so \"by finding tuples in each case that meet a certain condition (using f1nd_t8pl3s function with K9) and returns a combined list of these tuples.\" This correctly reflects that the new problem reuses the original functionality (f1nd_t8pl3s) as a building block and lifts it to a higher level over multiple test cases, combining their outputs. The relationship between raw and new problems is well understood.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (t3st_l1st, t3st_c4s3s, K9, f1nd_t8pl3s), Qwen correctly inferred the roles of each: t3st_l1st as a list of tuples, t3st_c4s3s as multiple test-case lists, K9 as the divisor, and f1nd_t8pl3s as the helper that performs the original filtering logic. It did not rely on the misleading names but instead followed the code structure: list comprehension with all(e7e % K9 == 0 for e7e in s8b) and a loop over t3st_c4s3s with extend(...) to aggregate results. This shows strong robustness to obfuscation and a structural understanding of the code.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified the core operation: filtering tuples where all elements are divisible by a given k.",
        "Correctly recognized input and output types for both raw and new problems (list of tuples vs. list of lists of tuples, and aggregated list of tuples).",
        "Understood the role of the helper function f1nd_t8pl3s and how it is reused in the new solution.",
        "Captured the transformation from single-case processing to multi-test-case aggregation.",
        "Showed clear robustness to obfuscated variable names by relying on control flow and expressions rather than names."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "In the new problem description, the divisibility condition is referred to only as \"a certain condition\" rather than explicitly restating the divisibility-by-k requirement.",
        "Did not explicitly mention the requirement to maintain the order of tuples as they appear across test cases, even though the described behavior is consistent with it."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a strong ability to infer semantics from code structure even when naming is heavily obfuscated. It correctly tracks how a helper function encapsulates the core logic and how that logic is lifted to operate over multiple test cases. The minor omissions in the new problem description (not restating the exact condition and not explicitly calling out order preservation) suggest that while Qwen understands the code behavior, it sometimes abstracts descriptions slightly, assuming context from earlier explanations. Overall, its understanding of the algorithm and the raw→new transformation is precise and robust."
