      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, Qwen's description matches the ground truth almost perfectly. The ground truth is: take two lists [a1,...,an] and [b1,...,bn] and return [a1+b1,...,an+bn]. The obfuscated code is a straightforward list comprehension over zip(lst1_k3p, lst2_v8r) returning a7z_2q + b9x_1m. Qwen states: \"element-wise addition of two lists, producing a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input lists.\" This captures the core semantics (element-wise addition), the input (two lists), and the output (a new list of sums). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations. Hence both semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth describes: input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two lists of equal length; the function should return a new list where each element is the element-wise sum of the corresponding pair of lists. Example: input [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]] → output [[4, 6], [12, 14]]. The obfuscated code is: [sum_list_w4t(lst1_k3p, lst2_v8r) for lst1_k3p, lst2_v8r in list_of_lists_j6n]. Given that sum_list_w4t (from the raw problem) performs element-wise list addition, this comprehension maps each pair of lists in the outer list to their element-wise sum, producing a flat list of result lists. Qwen's description: \"applying a function named `sum_list_w4t` to pairs of lists contained within another list, generating a new list of results from these function applications.\" Semantically, this is largely correct: it recognizes that the outer structure is a list of pairs of lists and that the function is applied to each pair to produce a new list of results. However, it does not explicitly state that the function performs element-wise addition, nor that the two lists in each pair are of equal length, nor that the result is specifically the element-wise sums. It also doesn't explicitly mention the structure \"list of lists where each sublist contains two lists\" in as much detail as the ground truth; it just says \"pairs of lists contained within another list.\" So semantic accuracy is good (it understands the mapping over pairs), but completeness is lower because it omits the key semantic of element-wise summation and the equal-length constraint.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: move from a single application of element-wise list addition on two lists to applying that same operation across multiple pairs of lists stored in an outer list. The new code uses sum_list_w4t as the core operation and maps it over list_of_lists_j6n. Qwen correctly identifies that the new problem is about applying the previously defined function to pairs of lists within another list and collecting the results. This shows an understanding that the new problem is a higher-order or batched version of the original operation. However, Qwen's description does not explicitly connect that the function being applied is specifically the element-wise addition function from the raw problem; it only names the function and describes it abstractly as \"applying a function.\" Thus, it partially but not fully captures the transformation: it understands the structural evolution (single operation → repeated over a collection of pairs) but under-specifies the semantic continuity (that the operation is element-wise summation). Hence a strong but not perfect score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated names (lst1_k3p, lst2_v8r, list_of_lists_j6n, sum_list_w4t) provide no semantic hints. Qwen nonetheless correctly inferred from the raw code that the core operation is element-wise addition via zip and +. For the new code, it recognized that the comprehension iterates over pairs (lst1_k3p, lst2_v8r) in an outer list and applies the previously defined function to each pair, producing a new list. This indicates that Qwen relied on structural and syntactic cues (zip, list comprehension, argument positions, function reuse) rather than variable names. The only notable gap is that, in the new problem description, it did not restate the specific semantics of sum_list_w4t (element-wise addition), even though that is inferable from the raw solution. Still, its ability to ignore misleading names and correctly identify the overall pattern is strong.",

      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong structural understanding of Python code even under obfuscation: it correctly interprets zip-based addition and list comprehensions over pairs, and it tracks the reuse of a helper function across problems. Its main limitation here is not in recognizing what the code does, but in fully verbalizing all relevant semantics—especially when moving from a single-operation function to a higher-order, batched version. This suggests that while the model can parse and reason about code structure reliably, it may sometimes under-specify or generalize the described behavior (e.g., \"apply a function\" instead of \"apply element-wise addition\") when summarizing more complex or layered problems."
