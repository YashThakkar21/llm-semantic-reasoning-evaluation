      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is specifically about computing the nth term of the Newman–Conway sequence. Qwen's description — \"The code calculates a sequence value based on a given integer input using a specific recurrence relation\" — correctly captures the core semantics: it recognizes that the function computes a sequence value from an integer input using a recurrence. It does not name the Newman–Conway sequence explicitly, nor does it describe the base cases or the exact recurrence, but it clearly understands that the code is about computing a sequence term via a recurrence. Hence, semantic accuracy is high but not perfect (missing the specific sequence identity), and completeness is moderate because it omits the name and any detail about the sequence definition or constraints.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: given k and a list of n_values, compute the sum of the first k Newman–Conway numbers for each n in n_values. The obfuscated code: m3_8t(a7_) builds the Newman–Conway sequence array up to index a7_ and returns the whole array; then the outer code iterates over f8k_ (the list of n_values), calls m3_8t(a7_) for each, and adds sum(b9x[1:x1p+1]) to w5_r, where x1p is k. So the function returns the total sum over all n_values of the first k terms of the sequence (note: it does not restrict to first min(k, n) or similar; it always sums indices 1..k assuming k ≤ a7_). Qwen's description — \"The code calculates the sum of sequence values up to a specified index for multiple inputs and accumulates these sums\" — is semantically close: it recognizes (1) summing sequence values up to an index, (2) doing this for multiple inputs, and (3) accumulating the sums. It misses the fact that the index is a fixed k across all n_values and that the sequence is specifically Newman–Conway, but it correctly grasps the structural behavior. Thus semantic accuracy is good, but completeness is only moderate because it omits the specific sequence identity and the explicit role of the parameters k and n_values.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: from computing a single nth Newman–Conway term to computing, for each n in a list, the sum of the first k Newman–Conway terms, and then (in the provided implementation) aggregating those sums into a single total. Qwen's raw problem description identifies that the base function computes a sequence value via recurrence; its new problem description identifies that the extended code sums sequence values up to a specified index for multiple inputs and accumulates the sums. This shows that Qwen correctly understood the evolution: the new code builds on the original sequence logic and adds an outer loop and summation. It does not explicitly articulate that the same sequence definition is reused or that the first problem is about a single term while the second is about partial sums, but its wording implicitly reflects that: from \"calculates a sequence value\" to \"calculates the sum of sequence values up to a specified index for multiple inputs\". Therefore, its understanding of the transformation is quite good, though not fully explicit about the parameter roles and the exact problem statement.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (a7_, b9x, q2z, m3_8t, f8k_, x1p, w5_r), Qwen correctly inferred the structural semantics: it recognized a recurrence-based sequence generator with base cases at 1 and 2, and a loop that fills an array using indices derived from previous values — characteristic of Newman–Conway. It also correctly saw that the new code returns the entire sequence array and then uses slicing and sum to compute partial sums for multiple inputs. Its descriptions are generic (\"sequence value\", \"sum of sequence values\"), which suggests it relied on control flow and indexing patterns rather than variable names. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation: the core behavior and the multi-input summation pattern were correctly captured even though no helpful naming cues were present.",

        "Did not explicitly state that the same underlying sequence from the raw problem is reused in the new problem; this is only implicit."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a solid grasp of the structural semantics of the obfuscated code: it correctly interprets a recurrence-based sequence computation and its extension to partial sums over multiple inputs. Its descriptions are intentionally generic, which costs completeness (no mention of Newman–Conway or parameter names) but shows that it is not misled by obfuscated identifiers. The model reliably tracks the transformation from computing a single sequence value to computing and aggregating sums of sequence values across a list of inputs. This suggests strong robustness to obfuscation and good high-level semantic understanding, even if it does not attempt to map the code to a known named sequence or restate the problem in fully detailed terms."
