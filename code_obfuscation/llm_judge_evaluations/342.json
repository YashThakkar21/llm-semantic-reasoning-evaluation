      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: return a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list. Qwen: \"creates pairs of consecutive elements from the list `a9z_3`.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it identifies that the operation is on a single list, that the output is pairs, and that the pairs are consecutive elements. No important aspect is missing or incorrect, and the description aligns perfectly with the one-line implementation using `zip(a9z_3, a9z_3[1:])`.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: use the pairwise function to find all pairs of consecutive items in two different lists and return the intersection of these pairs. Qwen: \"finds and returns a list of common pairs between two lists, `a9z_3` and `y8u_1`, where pairs are defined as consecutive elements within each list.\" This is fully aligned with the code: it recognizes that the function first forms consecutive pairs in each list (via `pair_wise`) and then returns the intersection (`set(x7_q2w) & set(e4_r5t)`). Qwen correctly captures that the intersection is over pairs that are consecutive within each list, and that the result is the common pairs. The semantics and intent match the ground truth precisely.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about generating consecutive pairs from a single list; the new problem extends this by applying that operation to two lists and intersecting the resulting pair sets. Qwen's raw description matches the first step (pairwise generation), and its new description matches the extended behavior (pairwise on both lists plus intersection). This shows that Qwen correctly understood the evolution: the new problem builds directly on the raw problem's functionality and adds a second list plus a set intersection of the pairwise results. There is no mismatch or missing step in its understanding of how the new problem relates to the raw one.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (`a9z_3`, `y8u_1`, `x7_q2w`, `e4_r5t`), Qwen correctly inferred that `a9z_3` and `y8u_1` are lists, that `pair_wise` produces consecutive element pairs, and that `set(...) & set(...)` computes the intersection of these pairs. It did not rely on names to guess semantics; instead, it used the structure of `zip(a9z_3, a9z_3[1:])` and the set intersection operation to infer the behavior. This indicates strong robustness to naming obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified that the raw code creates pairs of consecutive elements from a single list.",
        "Correctly recognized that the new code computes common consecutive-element pairs between two lists via intersection.",
        "Captured the notion that pairs are defined as consecutive elements within each list, not arbitrary pairs.",
        "Understood the relationship between the raw and new problems: the new problem reuses the pairwise operation and adds intersection across two lists.",
        "Showed no confusion from obfuscated variable names and relied on code structure and operations instead."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Descriptions are slightly informal and do not explicitly mention that the result is a list converted from a set (i.e., potential loss of ordering), though this nuance is not present in the ground truth either.",
        "Does not explicitly mention that the function is a general utility (\"write a function\"), instead describing what the snippet does; however, this is a very minor stylistic gap rather than a semantic one."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this problem, Qwen demonstrated a precise understanding of the semantics of the obfuscated code. It correctly interpreted `zip(a9z_3, a9z_3[1:])` as forming consecutive pairs and recognized the use of `pair_wise` plus set intersection as computing common consecutive pairs across two lists. The inferred descriptions align almost word-for-word with the ground truth intent, indicating that Qwen is effectively reasoning from control flow and operations rather than relying on variable names. This example suggests strong robustness to obfuscation when the code structure is simple and idiomatic."
