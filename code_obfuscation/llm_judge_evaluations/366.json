      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: sum of all odd natural numbers between l and r. Code: return s9m_0dd(r) - s9m_0dd(l - 1), with s9m_0dd(n) computing ((n+1)//2)^2. This is the well-known closed form for the sum of odd numbers from 1 to n. So the function indeed returns the sum of odd numbers in [l, r]. Qwen's inference: 'sum of squares of odd numbers between two integers l and r inclusive.' That is incorrect: the code uses a square in the formula, but the result is the sum of odd numbers, not the sum of their squares. Qwen correctly recognizes that the function is about odd numbers and a range [l, r], but misinterprets the mathematical role of the square, thinking each odd is squared. It also misses that the function is using a prefix-sum-style formula (f(r) - f(l-1)) to get the range sum. Thus, semantically it gets the domain (odd numbers in a range) but not the actual quantity being computed (sum vs sum of squares), and it omits mention of inclusivity via the l-1 trick. Hence low accuracy and completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: extend to multiple ranges (list of (l, r) tuples) and return the total sum of all odd numbers across all ranges. Qwen's new inference: 'updates a total sum by adding the sum of squares of odd numbers within a specified range from l to r.' This keeps the same core misunderstanding as in the raw problem: it still thinks the code is summing squares of odds rather than odds themselves. It also only describes 'a specified range from l to r', not multiple ranges or a list of tuples, and doesn't explicitly say that the function returns the final total across all ranges. The obfuscated snippet `t0t4l_s9m_xy += s9m_1n_r4ng3_zx(l, r)` clearly indicates accumulation over multiple calls/ranges, but Qwen's description reads more like a single-range update. So it partially captures that there is an accumulating total over ranges, but misses the multi-range input structure and still misidentifies the computed quantity.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: from computing the sum of odd numbers in a single range [l, r] to computing the total sum of odd numbers across multiple ranges (iterating and accumulating). Qwen's transformation: from 'sum of squares of odd numbers between l and r' to 'updates a total sum by adding the sum of squares of odd numbers within a specified range from l to r.' Conceptually, Qwen does recognize that the new version involves updating a running total using the per-range computation from the raw problem. That is the correct structural relationship: the new problem aggregates the base operation over multiple ranges. However, because its base semantic (sum of squares vs sum) is wrong, this error propagates. It also fails to mention that the new problem takes multiple ranges (e.g., a list of tuples) as input; it only vaguely talks about 'a specified range'. So it partially understands the transformation pattern (single-range computation → accumulated over multiple ranges) but misses the input structure and carries forward the core mathematical misunderstanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation is mostly in names, but the structure is simple: a helper s9m_0dd(n) that returns ((n+1)//2)^2, and the main function uses f(r) - f(l-1). Qwen correctly identifies that the computation concerns odd numbers and a range [l, r], which shows some robustness to naming obfuscation. However, it misinterprets the mathematical formula, assuming that the presence of a square means 'sum of squares of odd numbers' rather than recognizing this as the closed form for the sum of the first k odd numbers. This indicates limited mathematical reasoning about the code's arithmetic. In the new solution, it does see that a total is updated by adding the per-range result, but it does not infer the multi-range/list-of-tuples interface from the pattern. Overall, Qwen relies on superficial cues (odd-related arithmetic, accumulation) but fails to derive the exact semantics from the structure and formula, so robustness to obfuscation is weak.",

        "Misinterpreted the core mathematical operation as 'sum of squares of odd numbers' instead of 'sum of odd numbers', despite the prefix-sum pattern f(r) - f(l-1).",

        "Failed to mention that the new problem operates over multiple ranges (e.g., a list of (l, r) tuples) and returns the total across all of them.",
        "Descriptions are vague about input structure and inclusivity details, reducing completeness.",
        "Obfuscation in names seems to have led to over-reliance on the presence of a square operation rather than deeper reasoning about the arithmetic semantics."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows that it can pick up high-level structural patterns (range-based helper, accumulation into a total) even when variable names are obfuscated, but it struggles with correctly interpreting non-trivial arithmetic formulas embedded in the code. The presence of a square operation led it to an incorrect but superficially plausible interpretation (sum of squares) that it then consistently propagated to the new problem. This highlights a limitation: without explicit iteration over elements, Qwen may misread closed-form expressions and thus mischaracterize what is being summed. Its understanding of the transformation from single-range to multi-range aggregation is conceptually sound, but the lack of attention to input structure (list of tuples) and the propagated semantic error significantly reduce accuracy and completeness."
