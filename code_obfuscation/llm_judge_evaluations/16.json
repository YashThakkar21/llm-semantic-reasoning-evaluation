      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: given a list of digits, form the largest possible number. The obfuscated raw solution sorts the list in descending order and concatenates the digits into an integer. Qwen's description—\"sorts a list of numbers in descending order and then concatenates them into a single integer\"—matches the code behavior exactly and implicitly matches the intended problem (largest number from given digits). It correctly captures the core semantics (sorting descending, concatenation, integer result). The only minor omission is not explicitly stating that the input is digits and that the goal is to maximize the number, but that is clearly implied by the described operations. Hence, semantic accuracy is perfect, and completeness is high but not absolutely exhaustive in terms of problem intent wording.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: for a list of lists of digits, first form the largest number from each inner list (as in the raw problem), then concatenate those per-list largest numbers to form a final largest number. The obfuscated new solution is just: `return int(''.join(str(x7_q2(z8m_)) for z8m_ in b4_r9))`. Qwen's description: \"applies a function x7_q2 to each element in the list b4_r9, converts the results to strings, concatenates them, and returns the concatenated string as an integer.\" This is an accurate description of the given snippet itself: it recognizes the map-like application of x7_q2, string conversion, concatenation, and final int cast. However, Qwen does not connect x7_q2 to \"largest number from each list of digits\" nor b4_r9 to \"list of lists of digits\". It stays at the syntactic level of the given function call rather than inferring the higher-level semantics from the ground truth context. So semantic accuracy for the code snippet is good (it describes exactly what the code does), but relative to the ground truth problem, it misses the key idea that x7_q2 is the raw-problem function applied to each sublist. Completeness is therefore limited: it omits that each element is itself a list of digits and that x7_q2 is computing the largest number from that list.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new ground truth is: (1) lift the original \"largest number from a list of digits\" function to operate on each sublist in a list of lists, and (2) concatenate those per-sublist largest numbers into a final integer. The new obfuscated code indeed calls x7_q2 on each element of b4_r9 and concatenates results, which is structurally the correct transformation. Qwen correctly identifies that the new code applies a function to each element and concatenates the results, which reflects the structural transformation from \"single list\" to \"list of lists with per-element processing + concatenation\". However, Qwen does not explicitly articulate that x7_q2 is the earlier raw-problem function or that each element is a list of digits, so it misses the semantic linkage that the new problem is \"do the old problem on each sublist, then combine.\" Thus, its understanding of the transformation is good at the code-structure level but incomplete at the problem-semantics level.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mainly in variable and function names (a9z_, x7_q2, b4_r9, z8m_), not in control flow. Qwen completely ignored the misleading names and correctly inferred the behavior from the operations: `sort(reverse=True)`, `\"\".join(map(str, ...))`, generator expression, and `int(...)`. For the raw problem, it cleanly described the algorithm without relying on names. For the new problem, it correctly recognized the map-like pattern and concatenation despite meaningless identifiers. The main limitation in the new problem description is not due to obfuscation but due to not inferring the higher-level semantic role of x7_q2 and the structure of the input (list of lists of digits). So robustness to obfuscation is strong: Qwen relied on code structure and standard idioms rather than names.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly connect the raw and new problems semantically (i.e., that x7_q2 is the raw-problem function applied to each sublist).",
        "Did not mention that the inputs are digits or lists of digits, nor that the goal is to form the largest possible number in the new problem.",
        "New-problem description stays at a low-level operational description and misses the higher-level intent of \"largest number from each list, then concatenate\"."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong ability to understand code semantics from structure and common idioms even with heavily obfuscated names, as seen in its precise description of sorting and concatenation patterns. It excels at describing what each snippet does locally but is less inclined to infer the higher-level problem intent or to connect helper functions (like x7_q2) back to earlier defined semantics. This leads to high semantic accuracy for the raw snippet and structurally correct but semantically under-specified descriptions for the transformed (new) problem. For evaluating code understanding, this suggests Qwen is robust to naming obfuscation but may need guidance or additional context to infer and articulate the abstract problem-level semantics, especially across multiple related functions."
