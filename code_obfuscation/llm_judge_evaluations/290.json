      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description matches the ground truth exactly in semantics: it states that the code replaces spaces in the given string with '%20'. The ground truth says \"replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'\" and Qwen says \"replaces spaces in the string variable 'x7g2_p' with '%20'\". This captures the purpose, input (a string), and operation correctly and completely. There are no missing constraints or nuances for such a simple function.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen describes: \"The code processes a list 'v5_t9n' by applying a function 'f3k_m1' to each element, concatenates the results into a single string, and then splits this string by '%20'.\" This is semantically aligned with the ground truth: a list of strings is processed, each element is transformed (in context, replacing spaces with '%20'), then concatenated, then split by '%20' to return a list of substrings. Qwen correctly identifies the mapping over the list, the join into a single string, and the split by '%20'. The only slight gap is that Qwen does not explicitly restate that f3k_m1 is the space-to-'%20' replacement function, though that is implied from the raw problem and the code structure. It also does not explicitly say the input list is a list of strings, though \"processes a list\" plus the string operations strongly implies that. Overall, the semantics are correct, but the description is marginally less explicit than the ground truth about the nature of f3k_m1 and the type of list elements.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: (1) lift the single-string operation to a list of strings by applying the same replacement to each element, (2) concatenate all modified strings, and (3) split by '%20' to get a list of substrings. Qwen's new problem description reflects exactly these steps: applying f3k_m1 to each element of the list, joining the results, and splitting by '%20'. This shows that Qwen correctly understood that the new solution composes the original function over a list and then adds further processing (join + split). The relationship between raw and new problems is therefore well captured, even though Qwen doesn't explicitly say that f3k_m1 is the raw-problem function; the structural relationship is clearly understood.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The variable and function names (x7g2_p, v5_t9n, f3k_m1, q9_z8r, j4_x) are meaningless, yet Qwen correctly inferred the semantics purely from the operations: .replace(' ', '%20') on a string, list comprehension applying f3k_m1, ''.join(...) to form a single string, and .split('%20'). Qwen did not rely on names to guess behavior; instead it followed the code structure and standard library methods. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation: it recognized the mapping pattern over a list, the concatenation, and the splitting logic, and mapped them to a coherent problem description consistent with the ground truth.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the raw problem semantics of replacing spaces with '%20'.",
        "Correctly identified the list-processing pattern in the new problem: map, join, then split.",
        "Understood the high-level algorithmic flow despite meaningless variable and function names.",
        "Accurately reflected the relationship between the raw and new problems (lifting a string operation to a list and adding post-processing)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly state that the list elements are strings, though implied.",
        "Did not explicitly connect f3k_m1 back to the specific operation of replacing spaces with '%20' in the new problem description."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates that it can infer semantics from Python's standard string and list operations even when all identifiers are obfuscated. It recognizes common patterns like string replacement, list comprehensions, joining strings, and splitting by a delimiter, and can synthesize these into a coherent problem description that closely matches the original intent. The minor omissions are about explicitness rather than misunderstanding, indicating that its core code comprehension is strong and not dependent on variable naming quality."
