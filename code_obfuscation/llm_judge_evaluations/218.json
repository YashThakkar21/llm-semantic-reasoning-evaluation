      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the maximum product subarray of a given array. Qwen: \"calculates the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a given array.\" This is semantically identical and includes the key notion of contiguity and that we are dealing with a single array. It correctly captures the purpose, input (an array), and output (a maximum product over a contiguous subarray). No important detail is missing or wrong.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a 2D array (list of arrays), compute the maximum product subarray for each row and return the sum of these maximum products. Qwen: \"calculates the sum of the maximum products of contiguous subarrays for each subarray within a list of arrays.\" This matches the semantics: a list of arrays (2D structure), apply the maximum product contiguous subarray logic to each inner array, and sum the resulting maxima. The wording \"for each subarray within a list of arrays\" might be slightly less precise than \"each row\" but clearly refers to each inner array. All essential aspects—2D input, per-row/inner-array max product, summation—are present and correct.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about a single 1D array; the new problem generalizes this to a 2D array, applying the same operation row-wise and aggregating via summation. Qwen's descriptions reflect this evolution accurately: the raw description focuses on a single array; the new description explicitly mentions a list of arrays and summing the maximum products across them. This shows a correct understanding that the new solution wraps the original logic in a loop over the outer dimension and accumulates the results.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (a9_zX, b3_mQ, c7_wR, qR_3nM, wJ_7sL), Qwen correctly recognized the classic maximum product subarray dynamic programming pattern (tracking current min and max, updating a global max) and then saw that the new code simply defines this logic as pL_8vT and applies it to each inner array in arr, summing the results. The understanding is clearly based on the control flow and arithmetic operations rather than on any semantic hints from variable names, indicating strong robustness to obfuscation.",

        "Precisely identified the maximum product contiguous subarray algorithm in the raw solution.",
        "Correctly recognized that the new solution applies this algorithm to each inner array of a 2D structure and sums the results.",
        "Maintained the important notion of contiguity in both raw and new descriptions.",
        "Accurately captured the input-output relationships for both the 1D and 2D versions.",
        "Showed no reliance on variable naming, instead inferring behavior from logic and structure."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The phrase \"for each subarray within a list of arrays\" is slightly less crisp than \"for each row\" of a 2D array, though still correct.",
        "No explicit mention that the inner arrays are assumed non-empty (implicit in accessing index 0), but this is also not emphasized in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a complete and accurate understanding of both the base algorithm and its extension to a 2D setting, even with heavily obfuscated identifiers. It recognized the well-known max-product-subarray pattern and correctly interpreted the wrapper logic that iterates over the outer list and accumulates results. This indicates that Qwen is reasoning over control flow and arithmetic behavior rather than relying on naming, and it can correctly track problem transformations from a single-array version to a multi-array aggregated version."
