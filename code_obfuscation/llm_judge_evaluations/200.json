      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, Qwen's description is semantically spot-on: \"The code converts a list of integers into a single integer by concatenating their string representations.\" This exactly matches the ground truth: joining a list of integers into a single integer. It correctly identifies the input type (list of integers), the operation (string conversion + concatenation), and the output (a single integer). No important detail is missing or incorrect here, so both semantic accuracy and completeness are maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth states: given a list of lists of integers, join each sublist into a single integer and then sum those integers. The obfuscated code shown is only `return sum(zq3_w8r(m1_pL9) for m1_pL9 in x5_tY2)`, where `zq3_w8r` is presumably the raw-problem function (join a list of ints into one int). Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the sum of the results obtained by applying the function `zq3_w8r` to each element in the iterable `x5_tY2`.\" This is an accurate literal description of the given snippet, but it omits the semantic meaning that each element is itself a list of integers and that `zq3_w8r` is specifically the integer-concatenation function. It also does not explicitly say that the input is a list of lists of integers. Thus, while the control-flow/operation (map-then-sum) is correct, the higher-level problem semantics are only partially captured. Hence medium semantic accuracy and low completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: (1) lift the original function so it is applied to each sublist in a list of lists, and (2) aggregate the resulting integers by summation. Qwen's new-problem description recognizes that the new code applies `zq3_w8r` to each element of an iterable and sums the results, which partially reflects the transformation (map + sum). However, it does not connect this back to the original problem's semantics (joining integers in a sublist) nor does it explicitly identify that the elements are sublists of integers. It treats `zq3_w8r` as a black box rather than the known raw-problem function. Therefore, its understanding of the relationship between raw and new problems is incomplete: it gets the structural transformation (apply-then-sum) but misses the semantic evolution (from single list to list-of-lists of integers).",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mild (nonsense variable names like `a7x_9`, `x5_tY2`, `m1_pL9`, and function `zq3_w8r`). Qwen clearly did not rely on names to understand the raw solution: it correctly inferred that `int(''.join(map(str,a7x_9)))` concatenates integer digits, showing strong structural reasoning. For the new solution, it correctly recognized the generator expression and summation pattern despite obfuscated identifiers. However, it stopped at a generic description of \"sum of results of applying zq3_w8r\" instead of inferring the higher-level semantics (list of lists of integers, each converted to a single integer). This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation at the syntactic/control-flow level, it did not fully propagate the known semantics of `zq3_w8r` into the new problem description.",

        "Perfectly captured the semantics of the raw problem, including the concatenation of integer digits via string conversion.",
        "Correctly identified the high-level operation in the new code as summing over the results of applying a function to each element of an iterable.",
        "Showed robustness to meaningless variable and function names, relying on code structure rather than naming.",
        "Accurately described the control-flow pattern (generator expression + sum) in the new solution."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly state that the new problem input is a list of lists of integers.",
        "Failed to connect the known semantics of `zq3_w8r` (joining integers into one integer) to the new problem description.",
        "Described the new problem in terms of implementation details (\"apply zq3_w8r\") rather than the higher-level task (join each sublist into an integer and sum).",
        "Only partially captured the transformation from raw to new problem, missing the semantic shift from single list to list-of-lists."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong low-level semantic understanding of individual code snippets, even when identifiers are obfuscated: it correctly interprets `int(''.join(map(str, ...)))` and `sum(f(x) for x in iterable)` patterns. However, it tends to describe the new problem in terms of the immediate code structure (apply a function and sum) rather than integrating previously inferred semantics of that function into a richer, higher-level problem statement. This indicates good robustness to obfuscation and control-flow comprehension, but a gap in composing and reusing semantic knowledge across related snippets to fully capture problem transformations."
