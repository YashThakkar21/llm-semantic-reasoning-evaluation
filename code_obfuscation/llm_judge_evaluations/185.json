      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, i.e., sum_{k=1..n} (2k)^3. The given formula 2 * (n ** 2) * ((n + 1) ** 2) is indeed equal to sum of cubes of first n even numbers: sum (2k)^3 = 8 * (n(n+1)/2)^2 = 2 n^2 (n+1)^2.\n\nQwen's inference: \"sum of squares of the first n natural numbers multiplied by 4.\" That corresponds to 4 * sum_{k=1..n} k^2, which is not what the formula computes. Qwen did recognize that it's a closed-form polynomial in n and related to a sum over first n naturals, but misidentified both the power (cubes vs squares) and the exact structure of the formula. It also missed the key detail that these are even natural numbers. Thus, semantic accuracy is low but not zero, and completeness is similarly low because the crucial aspects (even numbers, cubes) are missing or wrong.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: for each even number up to m, take its index-based interpretation (first n even naturals) and compute the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, then sum those cube sums over all such n up to m/2. The provided new solution loops n from 1 to m // 2 and accumulates cube_Sum(n), where cube_Sum presumably implements the raw problem (cube sum of first n even naturals).\n\nQwen's inference: \"cumulative sum of cubes from 1 to m//2 using a function named cube_Sum.\" This captures that there is a loop from 1 to m//2 and that a function cube_Sum is being summed, but it misstates what cube_Sum does (it suggests cubes from 1 to n, not cubes of even numbers, and not explicitly 'first n even natural numbers'). It also does not articulate that the new problem is the sum of those cube sums (of even numbers) for each n up to m/2. Still, Qwen correctly grasped the high-level pattern: an outer accumulation over n from 1 to m//2 of some cubic-sum function. Hence semantic accuracy and completeness are middling rather than very low.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new: starting from a function that returns the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, the new problem defines a higher-level function that, for a given m, iterates n from 1 to m//2 and sums the raw function's result for each n. Conceptually, it's a nested summation: sum_{n=1..m/2} sum_{k=1..n} (2k)^3.\n\nQwen's descriptions do not clearly capture this relationship. In the raw problem, it misidentifies the underlying formula as a sum of squares scaled by 4. In the new problem, it describes a cumulative sum of cubes from 1 to m//2, but does not connect that this is repeatedly applying the raw cube-sum-of-evens function. Thus, its understanding of how the new problem is built on top of the raw one is weak. It partially sees that the new code is an accumulation over n using cube_Sum, but misses the specific semantics of cube_Sum and the fact that the new problem is 'sum of cube sums of first n even naturals'.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is relatively light: the key challenge is recognizing the mathematical meaning of the formula 2 * n**2 * (n+1)**2 and the loop that calls cube_Sum(n). Variable naming is not the main obstacle; the semantics are encoded in the arithmetic and control flow.\n\nQwen did identify that the code is about summations over the first n natural numbers and that the new code accumulates results of a cube-related function over a range up to m//2. However, it failed to correctly match the exact mathematical identity (sum of cubes of even numbers) and instead approximated it as a scaled sum of squares. This suggests that while Qwen can follow the structural pattern (loop + accumulator + helper function), it struggles with precise algebraic interpretation of closed-form formulas, even when names are not helpful. Its robustness to obfuscation is moderate: it did not rely on names, but its semantic inference from the arithmetic was inaccurate.",
      "strengths": [
        "Recognized that the raw solution is a closed-form expression derived from a summation over the first n natural numbers.",
        "Correctly identified that the new solution performs an accumulation over n from 1 to m//2 using a helper function cube_Sum.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Misidentified the underlying quantity in the raw problem as a sum of squares scaled by 4 instead of a sum of cubes of even numbers.",
        "Failed to mention or recognize that the numbers involved are even natural numbers in both raw and new problems.",
        "Did not clearly express that cube_Sum corresponds to the raw problem (cube sum of first n even naturals), weakening the understanding of the transformation.",
        "New problem description is vague about what exactly is being cubed and summed, losing the even-number and nested-sum nuance."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen appears reasonably capable of tracking control-flow structure (loops, accumulators, helper function calls) even when names are uninformative, which shows some robustness to obfuscation at the structural level. However, its algebraic reasoning about closed-form summation formulas is fragile: it recognized that the formula relates to a sum over first n naturals but misclassified the power and scaling, leading to an incorrect semantic description. This indicates that for mathematically dense one-line formulas, Qwen may approximate the intent rather than derive the exact identity. Consequently, while it can infer that the new problem is a higher-level accumulation of some cube-related function over a range, it fails to preserve crucial details like 'even numbers' and 'cube sums', which are central to the ground truth problems."
