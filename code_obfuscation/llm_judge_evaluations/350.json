      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: sum of non-repeated elements in a list. Code: `return sum(set(arr))`. Qwen: \"The code calculates the sum of unique elements in the list 'arr'.\" This is semantically correct and fully captures the behavior of the given implementation: converting to a set removes duplicates and summing gives the sum of non-repeated/unique values. There are no missing constraints or nuances here, so both semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are excellent.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: given a list of lists, find the sum of non-repeated elements across all sublists (i.e., uniqueness considered globally across all sublists). Obfuscated code: it initializes `t0t4l_5um = 0`, iterates over each `subl1st` in `l1st_0f_l1sts`, and does `t0t4l_5um += f1nd_5um(subl1st)`, then returns `t0t4l_5um`. Given the raw solution, `f1nd_5um` presumably computes the sum of unique elements in a single list. Thus the new solution, as written, sums the per-sublists unique sums, not the globally non-repeated elements across all sublists. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the total sum of all elements across multiple sublists ... using a function 'f1nd_5um' to sum each sublist.\" This is only partially correct. It correctly identifies that the function iterates over sublists and aggregates a sum via `f1nd_5um`, but it (a) ignores the uniqueness aspect (non-repeated elements) and (b) misstates that it sums \"all elements\" of each sublist, rather than \"unique elements\" of each sublist. It also does not capture the intended global non-repetition across all sublists from the ground truth problem. Therefore semantic accuracy is low-to-moderate, and completeness is low because the key nuance (non-repeated across all sublists) is entirely missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is: from summing unique elements in a single list to summing non-repeated elements across all sublists in a list of lists (a global uniqueness condition). The code transformation is: reuse the original function `f1nd_5um` on each sublist and sum the results. Qwen's transformation understanding, as reflected in its new problem description, is weak. It recognizes that the new version operates on multiple sublists and aggregates results from a helper function, but it fails to connect that helper to the earlier \"unique elements\" behavior and instead describes it as summing all elements. It also does not recognize or mention the shift from per-list uniqueness to global non-repetition across all sublists. Thus, while Qwen sees that the problem evolved from a single list to multiple sublists, it does not correctly capture the semantic relationship between the two problems or the intended change in uniqueness scope.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "For the raw problem, obfuscation is minimal and Qwen performs perfectly. For the new problem, the obfuscation is still light (names like `l1st_0f_l1sts`, `subl1st`, `t0t4l_5um`, `f1nd_5um` are readable variants of their meanings). Qwen correctly infers that `l1st_0f_l1sts` is a list of lists and that the code is aggregating over sublists. However, it seems to rely heavily on the immediate code snippet and its own generic interpretation (\"sum each sublist\") rather than connecting to the earlier function's semantics (sum of unique elements) or to the ground truth requirement of non-repeated elements across all sublists. The main failure is not due to name obfuscation but to missing the uniqueness nuance and the global vs. local uniqueness distinction. So robustness to obfuscation is moderate: it can parse structure and control flow, but it does not fully track semantic intent across related functions.",

        "Handled obfuscated variable names well enough to infer that `l1st_0f_l1sts` is a collection of sublists and `t0t4l_5um` is an accumulator."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missed the key \"non-repeated/unique\" aspect in the new problem description, instead describing it as summing all elements.",
        "Failed to recognize that `f1nd_5um` likely preserves the original behavior (sum of unique elements) and thus mischaracterized what is being summed per sublist.",
        "Did not capture the intended transformation from per-list uniqueness to global non-repetition across all sublists.",
        "Did not mention or reason about the distinction between local uniqueness (within each sublist) and global uniqueness (across all sublists), which is central to the ground truth new problem."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong understanding when the code snippet is simple and self-contained (raw problem), correctly identifying the use of `set` to enforce uniqueness. However, when semantics must be inferred across related functions (the helper `f1nd_5um` reused in a higher-level aggregation) and when the problem description involves a subtle change in uniqueness scope, Qwen falls back to a more generic interpretation (\"sum all elements of each sublist\"). This suggests that while Qwen can parse control flow and handle obfuscated names reasonably well, it is less reliable at tracking and reusing inferred semantics of helper functions across problem variants, especially when the key nuance (non-repeated elements, global vs local uniqueness) is not explicitly visible in the small snippet it focuses on."
