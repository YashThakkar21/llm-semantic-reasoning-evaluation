      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: count of binary sequences of length 2n where the sum of the first n bits equals the sum of the last n bits. This is a classic combinatorial counting problem; the count is sum_{k=0..n} C(n,k)^2. The obfuscated raw solution indeed computes sum of squares of binomial coefficients for a given n (k4_t1L): it iteratively computes C(n, i) and accumulates their squares. Qwen's inferred description: \"The code calculates the sum of squares of binomial coefficients for a given number k4_t1L.\" This matches the *implemented formula* exactly, but it does not connect this to the underlying combinatorial interpretation about binary sequences and equal sums of halves. So, while Qwen correctly understood what the code *computes numerically*, it failed to capture the semantic problem statement in the ground truth (binary sequences, length 2n, equal sums). Since the evaluation is about understanding the original problem semantics, this is a major miss. Hence semantic accuracy and completeness relative to the ground truth problem are both minimal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: count of all binary sequences of length 4n such that each consecutive block of n bits has the same sum (first n = next n = next n = last n). This is a more complex combinatorial constraint, extending the original 2-block equality to 4 blocks. The obfuscated new solution simply calls h2_y4K(k4_t1L) and returns its fourth power. Given the raw solution, h2_y4K presumably returns the count for the 2-block case, and the new solution raises that count to the 4th power, which does not actually match the ground truth combinatorial condition (so the provided \"new solution\" is itself not aligned with the stated new problem). Qwen's inferred description: \"The code computes the fourth power of the result returned by the function h2_y4K when called with the argument k4_t1L.\" This is a literal description of the code: it identifies that the function calls another function and raises its result to the 4th power. However, it does not relate this to binary sequences, 4n length, or equal sums across four blocks. Thus, relative to the ground truth new problem, Qwen's semantic understanding is essentially absent; it only describes the arithmetic transformation, not the problem semantics. Both semantic accuracy and completeness for the new problem are therefore at the lowest level.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is from counting binary sequences with equal sums in two halves (length 2n) to counting binary sequences of length 4n where all four consecutive blocks of length n share the same sum. Conceptually, this is a structured extension of the original combinatorial condition. Qwen's descriptions, however, treat the raw problem as \"sum of squares of binomial coefficients\" and the new problem as \"fourth power of h2_y4K(k4_t1L)\". It does not recognize or articulate any relationship between the two problems in terms of binary sequences, equal-sum constraints, or block structure. It only captures that the new solution is a power (4th power) of the result of the raw solution function, but even that is not framed as a transformation of the underlying combinatorial problem, just as a numeric operation. Therefore, its understanding of the raw→new transformation, in the sense of problem evolution, is effectively missing.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated names, Qwen correctly inferred that the raw solution computes the sum of squares of binomial coefficients via an iterative binomial coefficient computation. This indicates it followed the arithmetic and loop structure rather than relying on variable names. Similarly, for the new solution, it correctly identified that the function calls another function and raises the result to the 4th power. These show some robustness to obfuscation at the code-structure level. However, Qwen did not bridge from the numeric formula (sum of squares of binomial coefficients) to the underlying combinatorial counting interpretation (binary sequences with equal sums in halves), nor from the 4th power operation to any combinatorial construction for 4 blocks. That conceptual gap is not due to obfuscation of identifiers but due to not connecting known combinatorial identities to the problem statement. So, while it handled the obfuscation in terms of low-level code semantics reasonably (hence not a 1), it did not reach the higher-level semantic problem description.",

        "Failed to connect the computed sum of squares of binomial coefficients to the combinatorial problem of counting binary sequences with equal sums in two halves.",

        "Did not interpret the new problem as involving four blocks of length n with equal sums; instead, it only described a numeric power operation.",
        "Did not articulate any meaningful relationship between the raw and new problems beyond a superficial numeric transformation."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid low-level code comprehension under obfuscation: it can track iterative binomial coefficient computation and identify that the result is a sum of squared coefficients, and it can see that another function's result is raised to the fourth power. However, it largely remains at the level of numeric formulas and operations, without mapping these to the higher-level combinatorial semantics described in the ground truth problems. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscated naming for understanding what the code numerically computes, it struggles to infer or recall the underlying problem context (binary sequences and equal-sum constraints) when that context is not explicit in the code itself."
