      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the third side of a right-angled triangle, i.e., given the two legs, return sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Qwen: \"Calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin to a point (w7_3x, h2_9z).\" Mathematically these are identical operations: hypotenuse length = distance from origin to (a, b). Qwen fully captured the core semantics (inputs: two numbers; operation: sqrt(x^2 + y^2); output: a single float). The only difference is in interpretation (triangle vs. point), but the code itself does not encode the geometric context, only the numeric relationship. So at the code/semantics level, Qwen's description is exactly correct and fully aligned with what the function computes.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of tuples representing legs of multiple right-angled triangles, compute the sum of the third sides. Qwen: \"Calculates the sum of Euclidean distances from the origin to multiple points provided in a list, where each point is represented as a tuple (w7_3x, h2_9z).\" Again, this matches the implemented logic: iterate over a list of pairs, call the base function (hypotenuse/distance) on each, accumulate the sum, and return it. The only difference is interpretive framing (points vs. triangle legs), but all operational details are correct: list input, tuple structure, per-element computation, summation, and returned scalar. Completeness is high: Qwen mentions that each element is a tuple, that the function returns the sum, and that the operation is Euclidean distance (i.e., hypotenuse).",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: single-triangle hypotenuse → list of triangles, sum of hypotenuses. Qwen's inferred transformation is: single-point distance from origin → list of points, sum of distances. Structurally and algorithmically, this is the same transformation: scalar computation generalized to a list with aggregation via summation. Qwen clearly understood that the new function is a higher-level wrapper that repeatedly applies the original function over a collection and accumulates the result. Thus, its understanding of the transformation is fully correct, even though it uses a different but mathematically equivalent geometric interpretation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated names (w7_3x, h2_9z, t5r_9m, k9_w1, x3_p2) provide no semantic hints. Qwen correctly ignored the misleading identifiers and focused on the arithmetic structure: math.sqrt(x*x + y*y) and a loop summing calls to that function over a list of tuples. It recognized the pattern as Euclidean distance/hypotenuse and then generalized that to a sum over multiple inputs. This shows strong robustness to obfuscation: the reasoning is driven by code structure and mathematical form, not by variable names.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified the core mathematical operation as sqrt(x^2 + y^2).",
        "Accurately described input and output types for both the raw and new functions.",
        "Recognized the higher-order pattern: applying the base computation over a list and summing results.",
        "Did not rely on variable names; instead used the arithmetic and control flow to infer semantics.",
        "Maintained internal consistency between the raw and new problem descriptions (distance vs. sum of distances)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention the right-angled triangle context or the term 'hypotenuse', which appears in the ground truth description.",
        "Framed the problem in terms of points and distances rather than triangles and third sides, though this is a semantic framing difference rather than a code-understanding error."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated that it can abstract from obfuscated code to the underlying mathematical and algorithmic structure. Even though it chose a different but equivalent geometric interpretation (distance from origin vs. third side of a right triangle), its understanding of what the code computes is precise. The model also correctly captured the evolution from a single-instance computation to a batched, aggregated computation. This example shows that for simple numerical patterns like sqrt(x^2 + y^2), Qwen is robust to naming noise and can generalize the semantics across related functions."
