      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: divide two lists element-wise. Qwen's inference: \"The code divides elements from two lists, nums1 and nums2, element-wise and returns the results as a list.\" This matches the semantics exactly: two input lists, element-wise division, and returning a list of results. It captures the operation (division), the granularity (element-wise), the inputs (two lists), and the output type (list). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations for such a simple task.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of lists, where each sublist contains two lists of numbers, divide corresponding elements of the two lists in each sublist and return a list of the results. Qwen's inference: \"The code applies a division function, div_list, to pairs of elements contained within sublists of a larger list, list_of_lists, and returns the results as a list.\" This correctly identifies: (1) the outer structure (a larger list of sublists), (2) that each sublist contains a pair used as arguments to div_list, (3) that div_list is the element-wise division function from the raw problem, and (4) that the function returns a list of results. While Qwen phrases it as \"pairs of elements\" rather than explicitly \"two lists of numbers\" in each sublist, the code context (div_list(sublist[0], sublist[1])) implies these are the two list arguments, so the semantics are correct and sufficiently complete.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: lift the element-wise division of two lists into a higher-order structure where you now process multiple such list-pairs contained in an outer list. Qwen's new-problem description explicitly states that the code \"applies a division function, div_list, to pairs of elements contained within sublists of a larger list\" and returns the results. This shows it understood that the new solution reuses the original division behavior (div_list) and maps it over a collection of input pairs. That is exactly the intended evolution: from a single pair of lists to a list of pairs of lists, producing a list of division results. Thus, its understanding of the raw→new relationship is fully correct.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the task description mentions obfuscation, the provided snippets here are quite straightforward. Nonetheless, Qwen clearly based its understanding on the control/data flow: in the raw code, map(lambda x, y: x / y, nums1, nums2) implies element-wise division of two sequences; in the new code, [div_list(sublist[0], sublist[1]) for sublist in list_of_lists] implies iterating over an outer list and applying the previously defined division function to each pair. Qwen did not rely on misleading names; instead it correctly inferred the semantics from the operations and structure. Its descriptions align tightly with what the code actually does, indicating strong robustness even if names were less helpful.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured element-wise division semantics for the raw problem.",
        "Correctly identified input and output types (two lists in, one list of results out).",
        "Recognized that the new solution applies the original division function over a list of sublists.",
        "Accurately described the higher-order structure: a list of sublists each containing arguments for div_list.",
        "Maintained consistency between raw and new descriptions, reflecting the intended problem evolution."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The phrase \"pairs of elements\" in the new problem description is slightly less explicit than \"two lists of numbers\"; it could be clearer that each sublist holds two lists, not just atomic elements.",
        "No mention of potential edge cases (e.g., division by zero, unequal list lengths), though these are not specified in the ground truth either."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a complete and accurate understanding of both the base operation (element-wise division of two lists) and its lifting to a higher-order context (processing a list of such list-pairs). Its descriptions mirror the ground truth closely, including the relationship between the raw and new problems. This indicates that Qwen is effectively reading the code structure and functional composition rather than relying on naming, and can correctly track how a helper function (div_list) is reused in a more complex setting."
