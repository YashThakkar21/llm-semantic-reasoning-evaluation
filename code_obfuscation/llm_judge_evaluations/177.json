      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is: \"Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.\" The obfuscated code is `return min(x7z * b2q for x7z, b2q in g9m1)`. Qwen's description is: \"The code snippet finds the minimum product of pairs from the iterable g9m1, where each pair consists of elements x7z and b2q.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it correctly identifies that the input is an iterable of pairs (tuples), that each pair has two elements, that their product is computed, and that the minimum of these products is returned. It also does not introduce any incorrect extra behavior. Completeness is also high: all key aspects (iterable of pairs, multiplication, taking the minimum) are present. The only minor omission is not explicitly saying \"tuples\" or \"list\", but \"iterable\" is sufficiently general and correct for the code shown.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: \"Given a list of lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within each sublist, and then return the maximum of these minimum products.\" The obfuscated code is `return max(k3x9_w2z(p8v4) for p8v4 in q7n2_m5t)`. Qwen's description is: \"The code snippet calculates the maximum value obtained by applying the function k3x9_w2z to each element in the iterable q7n2_m5t.\" From the code alone, Qwen's description is semantically accurate: it recognizes a max over the results of a function applied to each element of an iterable. However, it does not connect this to the specific domain semantics of the ground truth (list of lists of tuples, minimum products per sublist, then maximum of those). It treats `k3x9_w2z` as an opaque function and `q7n2_m5t` as a generic iterable, so it misses the crucial structure: that each element is a sublist of tuples, that `k3x9_w2z` is the \"minimum product\" function from the raw problem, and that the overall operation is \"max of per-sublist minimum products\". Thus semantic accuracy relative to the intended problem is partial (it gets the max-of-function-application pattern but not what the function represents), and completeness is very low with respect to the full problem description.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is: reuse the original function (minimum product over a list of tuples) as an inner operation applied to each sublist in a list of lists, then take the maximum of these inner results. Conceptually, the new problem is \"max over sublists of (min product within sublist)\". Qwen's new-problem description only states that the code \"calculates the maximum value obtained by applying the function k3x9_w2z to each element in the iterable q7n2_m5t\". This shows some understanding of the higher-order pattern (a function applied per element, then aggregated with max), but it does not relate this back to the raw problem's semantics. It does not recognize that `k3x9_w2z` is the previously defined minimum-product function, nor that each element is itself a collection of pairs. Therefore, Qwen does not really capture the semantic evolution from \"min over pairs\" to \"max over sublists of mins\"; it only captures the syntactic transformation \"wrap previous function in a max over an iterable\". Hence the low score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names, Qwen handled the raw solution very well: it correctly inferred that `g9m1` is an iterable of pairs `(x7z, b2q)` and that the code computes the minimum of their products. This indicates strong reliance on Python's unpacking pattern and generator expression structure rather than on variable names. For the new solution, Qwen also correctly recognized the pattern `max(f(x) for x in iterable)`, again independent of naming. However, it treated `k3x9_w2z` as a black-box function and did not infer or state that it corresponds to the previously described \"minimum product\" operation, nor that the elements of `q7n2_m5t` are structured sublists. So robustness to obfuscation is good at the local code-structure level, but weaker when it comes to connecting multiple snippets and reconstructing higher-level problem semantics across them.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not connect the new solution back to the semantics of the raw solution (that k3x9_w2z is the minimum-product function).",
        "Missed the higher-level data structure in the new problem (list of lists of tuples with integer pairs).",
        "Failed to articulate the composed operation \"maximum of per-sublist minimum products\".",
        "New-problem description is too generic to capture key constraints and nuances present in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong local semantic understanding of individual obfuscated snippets: it can correctly interpret tuple unpacking, generator expressions, and aggregation functions like min and max without relying on variable names. However, when the task requires integrating the semantics of one function (the raw problem) into a higher-order construction (the new problem), Qwen defaults to a surface-level description of the higher-order pattern and does not recover the richer domain semantics (list of lists of tuples, min-products per sublist, then max). This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation at the single-function level, its ability to track and reuse inferred semantics across related snippets is limited, leading to under-specified or overly generic descriptions for composed problems."
