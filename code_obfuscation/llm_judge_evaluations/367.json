      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: find the sum of an array. The obfuscated solution is `return sum(a8r_r)`. Qwen's inference: \"The code calculates and returns the sum of all elements in the list 'a8r_r'.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it identifies that the input is a list/array and that the operation is summing all its elements and returning the result. There are no missing constraints or nuances in this very simple problem, so the description is both accurate and complete.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of arrays, compute the sum of each array and then return the total sum of all these sums. The obfuscated code: `return sum(_s5um_(a8r_r) for a8r_r in arr4ay_s)`. Qwen's inference: \"The code calculates and returns the sum of sums, where each inner sum is computed from elements of sublists contained within the list 'arr4ay_s'.\" This aligns perfectly with the ground truth: it recognizes that `arr4ay_s` is a list of sublists, that each sublist is summed, and that those inner sums are then summed again. The hierarchical structure (list of arrays → per-array sum → total sum) is fully captured, with no missing details.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from summing a single array to summing across multiple arrays by first summing each and then aggregating those sums. Qwen's raw and new descriptions reflect exactly this evolution: the raw description focuses on summing one list, while the new description explicitly describes a \"sum of sums\" over sublists in a list. This shows that Qwen correctly grasped that the new problem generalizes the original by adding one more structural level (list of lists) and applying the same operation (sum) at both levels.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names like `a8r_r`, `_s5um_`, and `arr4ay_s`, Qwen correctly inferred the semantics purely from the code structure and Python built-ins. It did not rely on names to guess behavior; instead, it recognized the use of `sum(...)` over a list and a generator expression `sum(_s5um_(a8r_r) for a8r_r in arr4ay_s)` as a nested summation over sublists. The explanation uses the obfuscated names only as labels for the data structures, while correctly describing their roles (list, sublists). This indicates strong robustness to naming obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the core operation (summation) in both raw and new problems.",
        "Correctly recognized the data structure change from a single list to a list of sublists.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "For this particular simple problem, there are effectively no substantive weaknesses; the descriptions match the ground truth almost verbatim in meaning."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can accurately infer semantics from very short, obfuscated code by focusing on language constructs and control/data structure patterns rather than variable names. It not only captured the behavior of each individual snippet but also correctly understood the conceptual generalization from the raw to the new problem (single-level sum → two-level nested sum). For straightforward functional code using standard library functions, Qwen demonstrates near-perfect semantic understanding even under obfuscation."
