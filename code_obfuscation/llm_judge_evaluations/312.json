      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description matches the ground truth exactly in semantics: it identifies that the function computes the lateral surface area of a cone given radius and height. The formula implied by the code (using sqrt(r^2 + h^2) and then π * r * slant_height) is correctly summarized as lateral surface area. Inputs (radius, height) and the output (lateral surface area) are correctly captured. There are no missing or incorrect details for this simple problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen correctly states that the code calculates the total lateral surface area of multiple cones, each represented as a tuple (radius, height) in a list. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth: iterating over a list of cones, unpacking radius and height, calling the single-cone lateral surface area function, and summing the results. The description captures the aggregation over multiple cones and the representation of each cone as a tuple, which are the key aspects of the new problem.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from the raw to the new problem is from computing the lateral surface area of a single cone to computing the total lateral surface area of multiple cones by summing the single-cone areas. Qwen's two descriptions reflect this evolution precisely: the raw problem is single-cone computation; the new problem is multi-cone total via a list of (radius, height) tuples. This shows a correct understanding of how the new problem builds directly on the raw one by generalizing to a collection and aggregating results.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated variable names (r4x_2w, h3n_5t, c0n3s_7y, etc.), Qwen correctly inferred their roles from the code structure: r4x_2w and h3n_5t as radius and height, c0n3s_7y as the list of cones, and the loop plus accumulation as a total. It did not rely on the misleading names but instead on the mathematical operations (sqrt of sum of squares, multiplication by π and radius) and the iteration pattern. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the mathematical quantity being computed (lateral surface area of a cone).",
        "Correctly recognized input and output semantics for both single and multiple cones.",
        "Accurately described the list-of-tuples representation for multiple cones.",
        "Captured the aggregation pattern (summing areas) in the new problem.",
        "Showed no confusion from the obfuscated variable names, relying instead on code logic."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Given the simplicity of the problem, there are no substantive weaknesses; all relevant details are covered."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can fully recover the intended semantics of straightforward geometric code even when variable names are heavily obfuscated. It correctly interprets both the underlying formula and the structural transformation from a single-entity function to a multi-entity aggregator. The performance here suggests that for simple mathematical and iterative patterns, Qwen relies primarily on operations and control flow rather than identifier names, leading to perfect alignment with the ground truth descriptions."
