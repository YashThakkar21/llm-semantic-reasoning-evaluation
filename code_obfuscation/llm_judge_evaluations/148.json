      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers. Code: `2 * n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 3` is (4/3)*n(n+1)(2n+1), which equals 4 * (sum of squares of first n natural numbers), i.e., sum of squares of first n even numbers. Qwen's description: 'sum of squares of the first n natural numbers'. It missed the 'even' qualifier and thus describes a different mathematical quantity. It did recognize that it's using a mathematical formula for a sum of squares, but not the specific variant. So the semantic core (sum of squares via formula) is partially right, but the target sequence (even vs all naturals) is wrong, and that is the central point of the problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: input is a list of integers; for each integer n, compute the sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers; return a list of these sums. Code: `return [square_Sum(num) for num in numbers]`, where `square_Sum` is the earlier function that computes the even-number sum-of-squares. Qwen's description: 'Generates a list of sums of squares for each number in the input list 'numbers'.' This captures the list-processing pattern (map each input to a sum-of-squares value) and the input/output structure correctly. However, it again omits the crucial 'even natural numbers' detail and implicitly assumes 'first n natural numbers'. So the high-level mapping behavior is understood, but the key mathematical nuance is missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: scalar → vectorized; single n → list of n's; same underlying computation (sum of squares of first n even naturals) applied elementwise. Qwen's raw and new descriptions are consistent with that pattern: first, a scalar function computing a sum of squares; then, a list function that applies that computation to each element. So it did understand the structural transformation (lifting the scalar function to lists). However, because it misidentified the base computation (natural vs even natural numbers), that misunderstanding is propagated. Thus, the relational aspect (\"do the same thing for each element in a list\") is correctly captured, but the specific nature of \"the same thing\" is not.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the code is obfuscated in naming, the key distinguishing factor here is the formula itself. The formula used is not the standard n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for the first n natural numbers, but a scaled variant corresponding to even numbers. Qwen appears to have recognized a familiar pattern (sum of squares of first n naturals) and defaulted to that, rather than carefully matching the coefficients and inferring the 'even' aspect. This suggests that its reasoning leaned on pattern recognition and prior knowledge more than on precise algebraic analysis of the code. The list comprehension in the new solution is straightforward, so obfuscation had little impact there; the main semantic miss is in the mathematical detail, not in control-flow or data-flow understanding.",

        "Failed to distinguish between 'first n natural numbers' and 'first n even natural numbers', which is the key semantic detail of the problem.",
        "Did not analyze the specific coefficients in the formula closely enough to infer the 'even' nature of the sequence.",
        "Propagated the initial misunderstanding into the new problem description, so the transformation is only partially correct.",
        "Relied on recognizing a familiar formula pattern rather than carefully deriving what the implemented formula actually computes."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a decent grasp of structural and higher-order patterns: it understands mapping a scalar computation over a list and recognizes that the code is computing a sum of squares via a formula. However, when the formula is a non-standard variant (here, corresponding to even numbers), it defaults to the most common interpretation (sum of squares of first n naturals) instead of verifying the exact semantics. This highlights a limitation in precise mathematical reasoning about code: it can match patterns but may miss subtle coefficient differences that change the problem's meaning. Obfuscation of names did not play a major role here; the main challenge was distinguishing closely related mathematical formulas."
