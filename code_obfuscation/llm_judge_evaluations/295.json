      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the sum of XOR of all pairs of numbers in a given list. Qwen: \"calculates the sum of XOR values for all unique pairs in an array.\" This matches the code exactly: the nested loops iterate over indices i and j with j > i, so each unordered pair is considered once, and the XORs are summed. Qwen correctly identifies that it's about XOR, that it's over all pairs, and that pairs are unique (no duplicates, no self-pairs). It captures the core semantics and matches the intended problem statement.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of lists, compute the sum of XOR of all pairs of numbers across all sublists, returning the total sum. The code iterates over each sublist and calls pair_xor_Sum on it, accumulating the results. Qwen: \"calculates the cumulative sum of XOR values for all unique pairs across multiple arrays.\" This is semantically aligned: 'multiple arrays' corresponds to the list of lists, and 'cumulative sum' corresponds to summing the results from each sublist. It also preserves the 'unique pairs' notion implied by the underlying pair_xor_Sum. No important detail is missing: it’s per-sublist pairwise XOR summed into a global total.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend from a single list to a collection of lists, and aggregate the same pairwise-XOR-sum operation over each sublist. Qwen's descriptions mirror this: raw is about one array; new is about 'multiple arrays' and the 'cumulative sum' of the same kind of pairwise XOR computation. This shows it correctly understood that the new problem wraps the original function and applies it repeatedly, then aggregates the results. The relationship between raw and new problems is accurately captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (a9z, x7k, q2w, m3x_p, b8r), Qwen focused on the control structure and operations: nested loops over indices, XOR operator (^), accumulation into a sum, and iteration over sublists with a helper function. It did not rely on names to infer semantics, instead correctly interpreting the algorithmic pattern. The mention of 'unique pairs' indicates it correctly read the loop bounds (j from i+1 to n), which is a structural detail independent of naming. For the new solution, it correctly inferred that arr_of_arrs is a collection of arrays and that pair_xor_Sum is the previously defined operation.",

      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a strong understanding of the algorithmic structure despite obfuscation, correctly inferring both the base problem (sum of XOR over all unique pairs in a single list) and its extension (aggregating that computation over multiple lists). Its recognition of 'unique pairs' shows it is reading loop bounds rather than guessing from names. The alignment between its raw and new problem descriptions and the ground truth indicates robust semantic comprehension and a clear grasp of how the wrapper function composes the original logic."
