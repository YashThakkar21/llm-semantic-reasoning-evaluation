      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Code: `return max(a7r) - min(a7r)`. Qwen: \"calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'a7r'.\" This is exactly the intended semantics: the maximum difference in an array is indeed max(array) - min(array). Qwen correctly identifies input (a list), operation (max minus min), and output (that difference). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of arrays, find the maximum difference between any two elements across all arrays, returning the maximum difference found. Obfuscated code loops over `arr4ys`, calls `m4x_Abs_D1ff(a7r)` (which corresponds to max-min for each subarray), tracks the largest such difference, and returns it. Qwen: \"finds the maximum absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values across multiple lists stored in 'arr4ys'.\" This matches the ground truth: multiple lists, per-list max-min difference, then the maximum of those. The word \"absolute\" is redundant but not incorrect, since max-min is nonnegative. All key aspects—collection of lists, per-list computation, and global maximum—are captured.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about a single array; the new problem generalizes to a list of arrays and asks for the maximum of the per-array differences. Qwen's raw description focuses on a single list's max-min difference; its new description explicitly talks about multiple lists in 'arr4ys' and the maximum difference across them. This shows a correct understanding of the transformation: the core operation (max-min) is reused, and the new layer is an aggregation over multiple arrays. The relationship between raw and new problems is accurately reflected.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `a7r`, `arr4ys`, and `m4x_Abs_D1ff`, Qwen relied on the code structure: use of `max()` and `min()` in the raw solution, and iteration plus a helper function in the new solution. It correctly inferred that `m4x_Abs_D1ff(a7r)` computes a max-min style difference for each subarray and that `m4x_d1ff` tracks the maximum over all subarrays. The obfuscation did not mislead it into misidentifying inputs, outputs, or the algorithm. Its descriptions are neutral to naming and grounded in the actual operations.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured that the raw function computes max(array) - min(array), which is the maximum difference between any two elements.",
        "Correctly identified that the new function operates over multiple lists and returns the maximum of the per-list differences.",
        "Understood the reuse of the core operation (max-min difference) from the raw problem in the new problem.",
        "Was not thrown off by obfuscated variable and function names; focused on control flow and built-in functions.",
        "Used terminology (maximum and minimum values, multiple lists) that aligns closely with the ground truth problem statements."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Minor redundancy in calling the difference \"absolute\" in the new problem, though it does not introduce an error.",
        "Does not explicitly state that the result is a single scalar value in both problems, though this is strongly implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated that it can abstract away from naming and focus on the semantics implied by operations like max(), min(), and iteration. It not only matched the raw problem's intent but also correctly recognized the higher-order pattern in the new problem: applying a known operation to each element of a collection and aggregating the results. This indicates robust understanding of simple algorithmic patterns even under obfuscation and an accurate grasp of how a base problem can be generalized to a more complex variant."
