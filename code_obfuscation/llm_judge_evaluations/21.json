      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The raw solution code is:\n\n```python\nreturn max(abs(a_8x - b_9y) for a_8x, b_9y in test_list)\n```\n\nGround truth raw problem: \"Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.\"\n\nQwen's inference: \"The code calculates the maximum absolute difference between elements of pairs in a list named 'test_list'.\"\n\nThis is semantically spot on. The code iterates over each tuple in `test_list`, unpacks it into two elements, computes the absolute difference, and returns the maximum of these differences. Qwen correctly identifies:\n- The input is a list (`test_list`) of pairs (tuples) of numbers.\n- For each pair, it computes the absolute difference between the two elements.\n- It returns the maximum such difference.\n\nThe ground truth wording \"between available pairs in the given tuple list\" is slightly ambiguous, but given the code, it clearly means \"within each tuple, between its two elements\" rather than between different tuples. Qwen's description matches the actual code behavior exactly and is even more precise by explicitly mentioning \"absolute difference\" and that the list is named `test_list`.\n\nThus, both semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are fully satisfied.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The obfuscated new solution is:\n\n```python\nmax_sum_z3q = 0\nfor i_7w in range(len(tuple_list_4k)):\n    for j_2m in range(i_7w + 1, len(tuple_list_4k)):\n        max_sum_z3q += max_difference_6r([tuple_list_4k[i_7w], tuple_list_4k[j_2m]])\nreturn max_sum_z3q\n```\n\nGround truth new problem: \"Given a list of tuples, each containing two integers, write a function to find the maximum sum of differences between all possible pairs of tuples. Each tuple in the list should be compared with every other tuple exactly once.\"\n\nQwen's inference: \"The code computes the cumulative sum of the maximum differences between all unique pairs of tuples in a list named 'tuple_list_4k'.\"\n\nFrom the code, we can infer:\n- Input: `tuple_list_4k`, a list of tuples.\n- The outer and inner loops iterate over all index pairs `(i, j)` with `j > i`, so each unordered pair of distinct tuples is considered exactly once.\n- For each pair of tuples, it calls `max_difference_6r` on a list containing those two tuples, and adds the result to `max_sum_z3q`.\n- Finally returns `max_sum_z3q`.\n\nGiven the raw problem and its solution, it is natural to infer that `max_difference_6r` computes the maximum absolute difference between elements of pairs in its input list. With two tuples as input, that corresponds to the \"maximum difference\" between those two tuples according to the original problem's notion of difference. The ground truth new problem describes exactly this: summing those maximum differences over all unique tuple pairs.\n\nQwen's description captures:\n- That it is a cumulative sum (\"cumulative sum\" matches \"maximum sum of differences\").\n- That it is over all unique pairs of tuples (the nested loops with `j_2m` starting at `i_7w + 1`).\n- That the quantity being summed is the maximum difference for each pair (\"maximum differences between all unique pairs of tuples\").\n\nThe only minor omission is that Qwen does not explicitly say \"each tuple contains two integers\", but that detail is not visible directly in the provided snippet and is a type-level constraint rather than a behavioral one. Behaviorally, Qwen's description matches the ground truth very well, so both semantic accuracy and completeness are effectively full marks for the new problem.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is:\n- Raw: For each tuple, compute the absolute difference between its two elements and take the maximum over the list.\n- New: For every unordered pair of tuples in the list, compute the \"maximum difference\" between that pair (using the same notion as in the raw problem) and sum these values.\n\nThe new code uses `max_difference_6r` on a list of two tuples, which is clearly intended to reuse the raw-problem logic on a reduced list of tuples. The nested loops ensure each pair of tuples is considered exactly once, and the results are accumulated.\n\nQwen's raw and new descriptions are consistent with this transformation:\n- Raw: \"maximum absolute difference between elements of pairs in a list\" — matches the helper function behavior.\n- New: \"cumulative sum of the maximum differences between all unique pairs of tuples\" — correctly reflects that the original operation is now applied pairwise across tuples and aggregated.\n\nThus, Qwen not only understood each code snippet in isolation but also implicitly captured the relationship: the new problem generalizes the raw one by applying the same \"max difference\" notion across all tuple pairs and summing. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth transformation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mainly in variable and function names: `a_8x`, `b_9y`, `test_list`, `max_sum_z3q`, `i_7w`, `j_2m`, `tuple_list_4k`, `max_difference_6r`. None of these names are semantically helpful.\n\nDespite this, Qwen:\n- Correctly recognized that `test_list` is a list of pairs and that the generator expression iterates over tuples, not over arbitrary values.\n- Correctly interpreted the nested loops over indices and the `i_7w + 1` start as iterating over all unique unordered pairs of elements.\n- Correctly inferred that `max_difference_6r` is computing a \"maximum difference\" consistent with the raw problem, even though its implementation is not shown and its name is obfuscated.\n\nThis indicates that Qwen relied on structural and control-flow cues (loop ranges, unpacking patterns, aggregation pattern) rather than on variable names. The descriptions do not depend on any misleading semantics from the names and instead describe the actual operations performed. That shows strong robustness to obfuscation.",

        "Precisely captured the behavior of the raw solution, including the use of absolute difference and the fact that it operates on pairs within each tuple.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention that each tuple contains exactly two integers, though this is a minor type-level detail.",
        "Did not explicitly state that the difference is absolute in the new problem description, instead referring generically to \"maximum differences\" (though this is strongly implied by the raw problem)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a strong ability to infer semantics from minimal and obfuscated code. For the raw problem, it correctly interpreted a compact one-line comprehension and aligned it with the intended \"maximum absolute difference\" task. For the new problem, it correctly read the nested index loops as iterating over all unique unordered pairs and recognized the accumulation pattern as a sum over pairwise metrics. Importantly, it inferred the conceptual reuse of the raw-problem operation in the helper `max_difference_6r` without seeing its body, based on context and naming pattern, and described the new problem in a way that matches the ground truth transformation. This shows that Qwen is not just pattern-matching on names but is genuinely reasoning about control flow, data structures, and aggregation patterns, and can maintain a coherent mental model across related code snippets."
