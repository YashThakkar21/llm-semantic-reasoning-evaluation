      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, Qwen's description matches the ground truth semantics very well. The ground truth: sum of the first n even natural numbers raised to the fifth power. The code is `sum(x**5 for x in range(2, 2*n + 1, 2))`, which indeed iterates over even numbers 2, 4, ..., 2n and sums their fifth powers. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the sum of the fifth powers of all even numbers from 2 up to twice the value of n_4kl9.\" This is exactly what the code does and is equivalent to \"first n even natural numbers\". It correctly captures the input (n), the range (2 to 2n, step 2), and the operation (fifth power and sum). No important detail is missing or wrong, so both semantic accuracy and completeness are high.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth says: given a list of integers, for each integer n in the list compute the same sum as in the raw problem (sum of fifth powers of first n even naturals), and return a list of these sums. The obfuscated code is `return [t3_zq9x(m_8w1p) for m_8w1p in l5_r2n]`. This is a straightforward map: apply t3_zq9x (which is presumably the raw-problem function) to each element of the input list and collect the results. Qwen's description: \"The code applies the function t3_zq9x to each element in the list l5_r2n and returns a new list containing the results.\" This is semantically accurate about what this snippet does, but it is generic and does not connect back to the specific mathematical meaning (sum of fifth powers of even numbers). It omits that each element is an integer n and that t3_zq9x computes the sum of the first n even natural numbers to the fifth power. Thus, while the immediate semantics of the list comprehension are correct, the problem-level semantics (what the function is supposed to compute) are only partially captured. Hence medium semantic accuracy and low completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: lift a scalar function f(n) (sum of fifth powers of first n even naturals) to operate elementwise over a list of n values, returning a list of f(n) results. Qwen's new-problem description correctly identifies that the new code \"applies the function t3_zq9x to each element in the list ... and returns a new list\". This shows an understanding that the new solution is a mapping of the original function over a list. However, Qwen does not explicitly articulate that t3_zq9x is the function from the raw problem, nor that the transformation is from single integer input/output to list-of-integers input/list-of-sums output. The relationship is implicitly there via the mention of applying a function to each element, but the mathematical semantics of the transformation (same computation, now vectorized over a list) are not stated. So the understanding of the structural transformation is decent, but the conceptual linkage to the original problem's meaning is incomplete.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `n_4kl9`, `t3_zq9x`, and `l5_r2n`, Qwen correctly inferred the behavior of the raw code: it recognized the range pattern `range(2, 2*n + 1, 2)` and the exponent `** 5`, and described the computation in clear mathematical terms. This shows it relied on code structure rather than variable names. For the new code, Qwen also correctly interpreted the list comprehension structure and the mapping behavior, again not relying on names. The main limitation is not due to obfuscation but due to stopping at a structural description for the new problem instead of re-attaching the known semantics of t3_zq9x. Overall, robustness to obfuscation is strong: the confusing identifiers did not prevent correct understanding of the control flow and operations.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely described the raw solution as summing fifth powers of even numbers from 2 to 2n.",
        "Correctly interpreted the range parameters and step, mapping them to \"even numbers\" and the correct upper bound.",
        "Accurately recognized the new solution as applying a function to each element of a list and returning a list of results.",
        "Showed little dependence on variable names, instead using code structure and operations to infer behavior."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "For the new problem, did not restate or connect the specific mathematical meaning of t3_zq9x (sum of fifth powers of first n even naturals).",
        "New-problem description is generic and omits that the input list is a list of integers n and the output list contains the corresponding sums.",
        "Transformation explanation is implicit; it does not explicitly say that the new problem is the list-wise extension of the original scalar problem."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of arithmetic loops and comprehensions even under obfuscation, as seen in the raw problem where it fully reconstructs the intended mathematical description. When the code becomes a simple higher-order pattern (mapping a known function over a list), Qwen correctly identifies the structural pattern but does not always propagate the previously inferred semantics of the inner function into the new problem description. This suggests that its code understanding is solid at the snippet level, but its integration of context across related snippets (e.g., recognizing that t3_zq9x is the previously analyzed function) may be limited or underutilized when formulating higher-level problem statements."
