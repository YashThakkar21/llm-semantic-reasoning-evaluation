      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. The obfuscated code is simply `return a7_2x.count(x9_b)`. Qwen's description, \"Counts the occurrences of x9_b in the list a7_2x,\" matches this exactly: it identifies that the function counts occurrences, correctly treats `a7_2x` as the list and `x9_b` as the target element. There is no algorithmic nuance beyond using the list's `count` method, and Qwen captures the semantics fully and precisely.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem is: given a list of lists, count the total number of occurrences of a specific number across all sublists. The obfuscated code is `return sum(frequency(q3_zL, x9_b) for q3_zL in m8_vK_wR)`. Qwen's description, \"Calculates the total count of x9_b across all sublists in m8_vK_wR using a frequency function,\" aligns perfectly with the intended semantics: it recognizes that `m8_vK_wR` is a collection of sublists, that `q3_zL` iterates over sublists, that `frequency` counts occurrences within each sublist, and that the sum aggregates these counts. This matches the ground truth description in both purpose and structure, including the cross-sublists aggregation.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is from counting occurrences in a single list to counting occurrences across a list of lists by summing per-sublists counts. Qwen's two descriptions reflect this evolution accurately: the raw problem description focuses on counting in a single list, while the new problem description explicitly mentions \"across all sublists\" and the use of a frequency function in a summation. This shows that Qwen correctly understood that the new solution generalizes the original logic to nested lists and aggregates counts, preserving the core operation while extending the input structure.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated variable names (`a7_2x`, `x9_b`, `m8_vK_wR`, `q3_zL`), Qwen correctly inferred their roles from code structure: `a7_2x` as the list, `x9_b` as the element to count, `m8_vK_wR` as the outer list of sublists, and `q3_zL` as each sublist. It did not rely on names but instead on the operations (`.count`, `sum(...)`, `frequency(...) for ... in ...`). The phrase \"across all sublists\" shows it recognized that the generator expression iterates over sublists, not just elements, which is a structural understanding rather than name-based. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the core semantics of counting occurrences in a list for the raw problem.",
        "Accurately described the aggregation of counts across sublists for the new problem, including the role of the helper `frequency` function.",
        "Clearly reflected the transformation from a flat list to a list-of-lists scenario.",
        "Did not get confused by meaningless variable names and instead relied on control and data-flow structure.",
        "Used terminology (\"across all sublists\") that matches the ground truth intent very closely."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Does not explicitly mention that the counted item is a \"number\" (as in the ground truth wording), though the code itself is type-agnostic; this is a very minor omission.",
        "Does not elaborate on input/output signatures or edge cases, though none are implied by the simple code."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this simple counting task, Qwen demonstrated exact semantic alignment with the ground truth, both for the original and transformed problems. It correctly inferred the roles of obfuscated variables and the structural change from a single list to a list of lists with aggregated counts. The descriptions are concise yet fully capture the essential behavior, indicating that Qwen is relying on the operations and iteration patterns rather than variable naming. This example suggests strong capability in understanding straightforward functional transformations even under heavy name obfuscation."
