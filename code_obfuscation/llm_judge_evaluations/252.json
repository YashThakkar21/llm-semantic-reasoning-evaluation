      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is: 'Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.' The obfuscated raw solution is just `return even_ele(test_tuple)`, which clearly calls a helper that presumably does that work. Qwen's inferred raw problem description is: 'The code snippet returns the result of the function 'even_ele' applied to 'test_tuple'. The specific problem it solves is not clear without more context about the function 'even_ele'.' This is semantically accurate only at the trivial syntactic level (it describes a function call) but does not capture the actual problem intent (removing uneven elements). Qwen explicitly says the problem is not clear, so it fails to infer the semantics of the underlying task. Thus semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are both very low.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: 'Given a list of nested mixed tuples, write a function to remove uneven elements from each tuple and then sum all the remaining even elements from all tuples.' The obfuscated new solution iterates over `t3st_l1st`, calls `extr4ct_ev3n` on each tuple, filters to integers, sums them, and accumulates the total. Qwen's inferred new problem: 'The code snippet calculates the total sum of all even integers extracted from tuples within 't3st_l1st'. It iterates over each tuple, extracts even elements using 'extr4ct_ev3n', filters out non-integer values, sums the remaining integers, and accumulates this sum across all tuples.' This matches the core semantics extremely well: it correctly identifies that we are summing even integers across all tuples in the list, that `extr4ct_ev3n` extracts even elements, that non-integers are filtered out, and that the sum is accumulated. The only nuance not explicitly stated is that the tuples are 'nested mixed tuples' and that the original conceptual task is 'removing uneven elements' (odd numbers) before summing; Qwen instead describes the positive operation of extracting evens, which is equivalent in effect. Overall, semantic accuracy is excellent and completeness is high, missing only the explicit mention of 'mixed' types and the framing as 'removing uneven elements' rather than 'extracting even ones'.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new in the ground truth is: start with a function that removes uneven elements from a nested mixed tuple; then extend this to a list of such tuples and additionally sum all remaining even elements across all tuples. Qwen's raw-problem inference does not capture the original 'remove uneven elements' semantics at all; it only notes a call to `even_ele`. For the new problem, Qwen correctly describes the extended behavior: iterating over a list of tuples, extracting even elements, and summing them. However, because the raw problem semantics were not understood, Qwen cannot explicitly articulate the relationship between raw and new problems (i.e., 'now we apply the same even-element extraction to each tuple in a list and aggregate the sum'). So while Qwen understands the new code well, it does not connect it back to the original conceptual task. This yields a middling score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "In the new solution, variable names are heavily obfuscated (`t0t4l_5um`, `tup_9x`, `t3st_l1st`, `extr4ct_ev3n`, `ev3n_tup_7z`, `x8q`), yet Qwen correctly inferred the control flow and data transformations: looping over a list of tuples, calling a helper to get even elements, filtering by integer type, summing, and accumulating. This shows strong robustness to obfuscation in the non-trivial case. In the raw solution, however, the code is too minimal (`return even_ele(test_tuple)`), and Qwen did not attempt to infer the semantics of `even_ele` from the problem context or name; it simply stated that the purpose is unclear. While the name `even_ele` is actually somewhat informative, Qwen chose not to interpret it. Thus, robustness is good where there is enough structural information, but Qwen is conservative when only a single opaque call is present.",

        "Accurately described the new solution's behavior, including iteration over tuples, extraction of even elements, filtering to integers, and summation.",
        "Correctly inferred that `extr4ct_ev3n` is used to extract even elements despite obfuscated naming.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to infer the semantic intent of the raw problem (removing uneven elements) from the helper name `even_ele` and context.",
        "Raw problem description is purely syntactic and explicitly claims the problem is unclear, missing the core task.",
        "Did not explicitly connect the raw and new problems as an extension from operating on a single tuple to a list of tuples plus aggregation.",
        "Did not mention that the tuples are 'nested mixed tuples' or emphasize the 'removal of uneven elements' framing, instead only describing extraction of evens."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding when there is enough structural information in the code, even with obfuscated names: it correctly reconstructs the algorithm and its purpose for the new problem. However, when the code is extremely minimal and relies on a helper function whose behavior must be inferred from naming and context, Qwen is cautious and refrains from guessing, leading to a failure to capture the raw problem semantics. This suggests that Qwen's robustness to obfuscation is primarily driven by analysis of control flow and operations rather than by interpreting function names, and that it may underutilize weak but informative naming cues when structural information is sparse."
