      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: sum of all items in a given dictionary. Code: `return sum(a8x.values())`. Qwen's description: \"calculates the sum of all values in the dictionary 'a8x'.\" This is semantically exact: the function indeed sums the dictionary's values. Although the ground truth uses the phrase \"all items\", the implementation and Qwen both correctly interpret this as summing the values, which matches the code. Inputs (a dictionary) and output (a numeric sum) are correctly captured, with no distortion or omission.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of dictionaries, find the total sum of all items in all dictionaries. Code: `return sum(return_sum(z9q) for z9q in dict_list)`. Qwen's description: \"calculates the total sum of values returned by the function 'return_sum' when applied to each dictionary in the list 'dict_list'.\" This matches the actual behavior: for each dictionary in the list, it uses the helper to sum that dictionary's values, then sums those per-dictionary sums. That is exactly the \"total sum of all items in all dictionaries\". Qwen correctly identifies the role of `dict_list` as a list of dictionaries and the aggregation across all of them.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about summing values in a single dictionary; the new problem generalizes this to a list of dictionaries and sums across all of them. Qwen's raw description focuses on summing values in one dictionary, and its new description focuses on applying that same summing function to each dictionary in a list and aggregating the results. This reflects a correct understanding of the transformation: the new solution reuses the original behavior (`return_sum`) as a building block and lifts it to operate over a collection. The relationship between the two problems—single-dictionary sum vs. list-of-dictionaries total sum—is accurately captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is minimal but present: variable names like `a8x` and `z9q` are meaningless, and only `dict_list` and `return_sum` are semantically helpful. Qwen does not rely on misleading semantics from the obfuscated names; instead, it infers behavior from the operations: `sum(a8x.values())` clearly indicates summing dictionary values, and `sum(return_sum(z9q) for z9q in dict_list)` clearly indicates iterating over a list and aggregating per-element sums. Qwen correctly interprets these patterns and explains them in natural language without being confused by the arbitrary identifiers.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured that the operation is summing dictionary values, not keys or items as pairs.",
        "Correctly generalized from a single dictionary to a list of dictionaries in the new problem.",
        "Recognized and described the role of the helper function `return_sum` in the new solution.",
        "Showed reliance on code structure (`sum(...values())`, generator expression) rather than variable names."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly restate that the input to the raw function is a dictionary and to the new function is a list of dictionaries, though this is strongly implied.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that `return_sum` is the function implementing the raw problem, though again this is implicit in the description."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this problem, Qwen demonstrated exact semantic alignment with the ground truth: it correctly identified the core behavior (summing dictionary values) and the extension from a single dictionary to a list of dictionaries. The descriptions are concise yet fully capture the essential input-output behavior and the reuse of the original function in the transformed problem. The obfuscation did not hinder understanding, indicating that Qwen relied on the Python constructs and control flow rather than on identifier names. This example shows strong robustness and accurate reasoning about problem evolution from raw to new versions."
