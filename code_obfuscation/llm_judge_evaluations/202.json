      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description, \"Calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length,\" matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is \"Write a function to find the surface area of a cube of a given size.\" Both specify: (1) the geometric object (cube), (2) the quantity (surface area), and (3) the input (side length/size). The code snippet `return 6 * l * l` is correctly interpreted as the standard formula for cube surface area. There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations; the description is fully aligned with the intended task.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen's description, \"Calculates the total surface area of multiple cubes, each with side lengths specified in the 'sizes' list,\" is semantically identical to the ground truth: \"Given a list of sizes representing different cubes, write a function to calculate the total surface area of all the cubes.\" It captures: (1) input as a list of cube sizes, (2) each element representing a cube's side length, and (3) output as the total (sum) of their surface areas. This matches the code `return sum(surfacearea_cube(l) for l in sizes)` perfectly. No important detail is omitted or altered.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is from a single-cube surface area calculation to aggregating surface areas over a list of cubes. Qwen's new problem description clearly reflects this evolution: it moves from \"given its side length\" (single cube) to \"multiple cubes, each with side lengths specified in the 'sizes' list\" (collection of cubes). This mirrors the code transformation from a direct formula `6 * l * l` to a summation over a list using the helper `surfacearea_cube`. Qwen implicitly recognizes that the new problem reuses the original logic as a building block and extends it to handle multiple inputs and produce a total. This shows a correct understanding of the relationship between the two problems.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the code is presented as \"obfuscated,\" the snippets here are minimal and rely on a generic variable name `l` and a helper `surfacearea_cube`. Qwen does not depend on meaningful variable names; instead, it correctly infers the semantics from the arithmetic structure (6 * side^2) and the summation pattern over a list. The model correctly interprets `sum(surfacearea_cube(l) for l in sizes)` as iterating over a list of side lengths and summing their surface areas. This indicates strong robustness to naming and a focus on structural and mathematical cues rather than identifiers.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfect semantic match with the ground truth for both raw and new problems.",
        "Accurate identification of inputs (single side length vs. list of side lengths) and outputs (surface area vs. total surface area).",
        "Clear understanding of the extension from a single-instance computation to a list-based aggregation.",
        "Relies on code structure and mathematical formula rather than variable naming, showing robustness to obfuscation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "In this particular example, there are no substantive weaknesses; the problem is simple and fully captured."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can precisely infer the semantics of straightforward mathematical code even when variable names are uninformative. It correctly generalizes from a base function (surface area of one cube) to a higher-level function (total surface area of many cubes) and articulates the relationship between the two problem statements. The performance here suggests that for simple arithmetic and list-aggregation patterns, Qwen is highly robust to obfuscation and can match ground truth problem descriptions almost verbatim."
