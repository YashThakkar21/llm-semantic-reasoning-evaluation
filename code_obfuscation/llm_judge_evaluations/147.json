      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in an array formed by repeating a given array k times. Qwen's inference: 'calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array using Kadane's algorithm.' Semantically, Qwen correctly identifies that this is a maximum subarray sum (Kadane) problem, but it omits the crucial detail that the array is a modified array formed by repeating the original array k times. The provided obfuscated code snippet (`x7_9z = a * k`) clearly shows the repetition, which Qwen did not mention. So the core semantic of 'max contiguous subarray sum' is correct, but the 'repeated k times' aspect is missing, making it partially accurate but not fully aligned with the ground truth.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of arrays, each representing a modified array formed by repeating a given array k times, find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray for each modified array and return the maximum sum among all. Qwen's inference: 'finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray for multiple arrays, each repeated a specified number of times, and returns the highest sum found among them.' This matches the semantics very closely: multiple arrays, each with its own repetition factor (ks), computing the max subarray sum for each repeated array, and returning the maximum over all. The only minor nuance is that the ground truth emphasizes that each array is itself a 'modified array' formed by repetition of some base array, but functionally Qwen's description is equivalent. It captures the key operations, inputs, outputs, and the aggregation across all arrays.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from a single array + k (compute max subarray sum on the k-times repeated array) to multiple such (array, k) pairs and then taking the maximum result among them. Qwen's raw description missed the repetition aspect, but its new description explicitly mentions 'each repeated a specified number of times' and 'returns the highest sum found among them.' This shows that Qwen correctly understood the new problem as a batched/generalized version of the original repeated-array max-subarray problem. The relationship between raw and new is captured: the same core operation (max subarray on repeated arrays) applied to multiple inputs and aggregated by taking the maximum. Thus, its understanding of the transformation is strong, even though its raw description was slightly incomplete.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`x7_9z`, `q2_w`, `m5_t`, etc.), Qwen correctly recognized Kadane's algorithm in the raw solution: initializing a running sum (`q2_w`), updating it with `max(q2_w + b8_r, b8_r)`, and tracking a global maximum (`m5_t`). It also correctly interpreted `x7_9z = a * k` as forming the repeated array, at least in the new-problem description where it explicitly mentions repetition. In the new solution, it correctly saw the pattern of iterating over `arrays` and `ks`, calling `max_sub_array_sum_repeated`, and tracking the maximum over all results. This indicates that Qwen relied on control flow and operations rather than variable names, showing strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified the core algorithm as Kadane's maximum subarray sum.",
        "Accurately described the new problem as computing max subarray sums for multiple (array, k) combinations and returning the global maximum.",
        "Recognized the repetition-by-k behavior in the new problem description, aligning with `x7_9z = a * k` and the use of `ks`.",
        "Handled obfuscated variable names well by focusing on structural patterns (loop, running max, global max)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Raw problem description omitted the crucial detail that the array is formed by repeating the original array k times.",
        "Did not explicitly tie the raw problem description to the repetition logic, even though the code clearly shows `a * k`.",
        "Slight mismatch between raw and new descriptions: repetition is only mentioned in the new problem, not in the raw, despite both involving repetition."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong structural understanding of the code: it correctly identifies Kadane's algorithm and the higher-level pattern of applying it across multiple inputs and aggregating results, even with heavily obfuscated names. The main gap is not in algorithm recognition but in fully capturing all problem-specific constraints in the raw problem, specifically the repetition-by-k aspect. Interestingly, Qwen does recognize and articulate the repetition clearly in the new problem, suggesting that its understanding of the overall system (multiple arrays with ks) is solid, but its single-instance (raw) description was overly generic. This indicates that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation and good at algorithm-level semantics, it can under-specify certain problem details when summarizing individual functions."
