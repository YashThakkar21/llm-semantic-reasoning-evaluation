      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: given a list of numbers, compute the sum of digits of each number (typically returning a list of per-number digit sums). The obfuscated raw solution actually returns a single total sum of all digits across the list. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the sum of all digits found in the string representations of elements within an iterable named 'b9m'.\" This matches the actual code behavior exactly: it iterates over b9m, converts each element to string, filters digits, converts them to int, and sums them all into one scalar. Semantically, Qwen correctly captures the core operation (sum of digits) and the overall output (a single sum). It does not mention that the input is conceptually a list of numbers (it just says iterable), and it does not distinguish between the intended problem statement (per-element sums) and the implemented behavior (global sum). For evaluating understanding of the given code, however, Qwen is accurate. Completeness is moderate: it omits that non-digit characters are ignored and that elements are likely numbers, but the main behavior is there.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: given a list of lists of numbers, compute the sum of digits of each number in each sublist, then return the total sum of all these sums. The obfuscated new solution is just `return sum(f4r_9x(k3l_8q) for k3l_8q in v7n_2m)`, which by itself only shows that we sum the results of a helper function over an iterable; the digit-sum semantics live inside f4r_9x and are not visible here. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the sum of the results of applying the function 'f4r_9x' to each element in the iterable named 'v7n_2m'.\" This is a literal reading of the visible code and is semantically correct for that snippet, but it completely misses the higher-level intent from the ground truth: that v7n_2m is a list of lists of numbers and that f4r_9x is (presumably) computing digit sums. It also does not mention nested structure, digits, or numbers at all. Thus semantic accuracy relative to the intended problem is low-to-moderate, and completeness is poor.",
      "transformation_analysis": "Ground truth transformation: raw problem is about computing digit sums per number in a flat list; new problem generalizes to a list of lists and asks for the total sum of all digit sums across all sublists. Conceptually, the transformation is: (1) introduce nested structure (list of lists), (2) still compute digit sums per number, (3) aggregate all those sums into one total. Qwen's raw description focuses on summing all digits across an iterable, and its new description focuses on summing the outputs of a helper function over an iterable. It does not recognize or articulate any change in data structure (flat list → list of lists), nor any specific semantics of f4r_9x (digit sums). It also does not relate the new problem back to the raw one as a generalization or composition. Therefore, its understanding of the raw→new transformation is weak: it only captures that the new code is a higher-order aggregation (sum of function results) but not that the underlying task is the same digit-sum logic applied to a more complex input structure.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "For the raw solution, Qwen handled obfuscation very well: despite meaningless names (b9m, q2x, a8z), it correctly inferred that the code is summing digits across all elements by following the generator expression structure and use of `str()` and `isdigit()`. This shows reliance on code structure and Python built-ins rather than names. For the new solution, the obfuscation plus the absence of f4r_9x's body limited what could be inferred. Qwen did not attempt to guess that f4r_9x is a digit-sum function or that v7n_2m might be nested; instead it gave a generic but correct structural description. That is robust in the sense of not hallucinating semantics from bad names, but it also means it failed to connect to the ground truth intent. Overall, Qwen shows good robustness to obfuscation at the raw-code level, but its understanding remains shallow when key semantics are hidden behind helper functions.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately described the actual behavior of the raw obfuscated code: summing all digits from the string representations of elements in an iterable.",
        "Did not rely on variable names; instead used control flow and built-in methods (`str`, `isdigit`, `int`, `sum`) to infer semantics.",
        "For the new solution, gave a structurally correct description of what the visible code does (sum of applying a function over an iterable), avoiding unjustified assumptions."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not capture the intended per-element digit-sum vs. total-sum distinction in the raw problem relative to the ground truth description.",
        "Failed to identify or even hypothesize the digit-sum semantics and nested list structure in the new problem, missing key aspects of the ground truth.",
        "Did not articulate the relationship between the raw and new problems as a generalization to nested lists and aggregation of digit sums.",
        "Transformation understanding is shallow: it only notes a generic higher-order pattern (sum of function results) without connecting to the original task."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen is strong at reading direct, low-level semantics from a single expression, even when variable names are obfuscated, as shown in the raw solution analysis. It correctly follows generator expressions and built-in methods to infer that digits are being extracted and summed. However, when semantics are factored out into a helper function (f4r_9x) and the code snippet is minimal, Qwen defaults to a safe, structural description and does not infer the higher-level intent or data-shape changes implied by the ground truth. This suggests that its code understanding is primarily local and syntax-driven; it excels when behavior is explicit in the snippet but struggles to reconstruct the broader problem specification or evolution (raw→new) without seeing all relevant function bodies or additional context."
