      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a matrix (list of lists), return the max of the n-th column. Code: return max([sub[N] for sub in test_list]). Qwen: \"finds the maximum value at index N from a list of lists (test_list).\" This is semantically correct: it clearly identifies that we are taking the maximum over the N-th element of each sublist. While Qwen doesn't explicitly use the word \"column\" or \"matrix\", its description is equivalent and fully captures the operation, inputs, and output. No important detail is missing for the raw problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of matrices, return a list of the maximum values of the n-th column for each matrix; if a matrix lacks that column, return None for that matrix. Obfuscated code: [max_of_nth(a7x_2q, b9_zR) if len(a7x_2q) > b9_zR else None for a7x_2q in w3_kLm]. This implies w3_kLm is a list of matrices, and max_of_nth computes the max of the n-th column of a matrix. Qwen's inference: \"generates a list where each element is the maximum value at index b9_zR from each sublist in w3_kLm, or None if the sublist is too short.\" Qwen interprets each element of w3_kLm as a simple sublist, not as a matrix, and thus misses the extra dimension: each element is itself a matrix, and max_of_nth operates over its sublists. Qwen correctly captures the high-level pattern (mapping over a collection, computing a max at index n, returning None when too short), but it flattens the structure by one level and does not mention matrices or columns. Hence, semantics are mostly right at the outer level (list of results, conditional None) but incomplete regarding the inner matrix structure.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about a single matrix and returning a single maximum for the n-th column. The new problem generalizes this to a list of matrices, returning a list of such maxima (or None per matrix if the column is missing). Qwen's raw description matches the single-matrix case. In the new description, Qwen recognizes that the new code produces a list of results and that each element corresponds to a maximum at a given index with a None fallback when the structure is too short. This shows an understanding that the problem evolved from a single computation to a per-element mapping with a None-for-missing behavior. However, Qwen fails to recognize that each element of w3_kLm is itself a matrix, not just a flat sublist, so it does not fully articulate that the transformation is from \"one matrix → one max\" to \"many matrices → many maxes\". It instead frames it as \"one list of lists → list of maxes over sublists\", missing the extra level of nesting implied by max_of_nth. Thus, it partially understands the transformation (list output, per-item handling, None behavior) but misses the structural nuance.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (a7x_2q, b9_zR, w3_kLm), Qwen correctly identifies the core behavior in both snippets: computing a maximum at a given index and, in the new code, mapping this over a collection with a length check and None fallback. It does not rely on variable names to infer semantics; instead, it uses the control structure (list comprehension), the conditional (len(a7x_2q) > b9_zR), and the helper function max_of_nth to infer intent. The main miss is not due to obfuscation but due to not inferring from context that max_of_nth likely implements the original \"max of n-th column of a matrix\" behavior and that each element of w3_kLm is a matrix. Given only the snippet, this is a subtle, higher-level inference; structurally, Qwen's reading of the code is robust to the bad names.",

        "Accurately captured the raw problem semantics: maximum of the N-th element across sublists.",
        "Correctly identified that the new solution returns a list of results, one per element in the outer collection.",
        "Recognized the conditional behavior: return None when the structure is too short to have the requested index.",
        "Showed robustness to obfuscated variable names by focusing on list comprehension structure, indexing, and length checks rather than names."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not recognize that each element in the new problem is a matrix (list of lists), not just a flat sublist.",
        "Failed to explicitly connect max_of_nth to the original \"max of n-th column of a matrix\" behavior, thereby missing the matrix/column terminology in the new description.",
        "Consequently, the description of the new problem is structurally one level too shallow compared to the ground truth (list of sublists vs. list of matrices)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of the core operations (indexing, max aggregation, mapping over collections, and conditional None for missing indices) even under obfuscated naming. It excels at the raw problem and at recognizing the outer-level transformation from a single result to a list of results with a missing-case fallback. The main limitation is in inferring higher-level domain structure (\"matrix\" vs. \"list\") and the role of the helper function max_of_nth, which leads to an under-specified description for the new problem. This suggests that Qwen is good at local code semantics and control-flow-based reasoning, but may under-infer domain-level abstractions when they are only implied by helper names or by the original problem context."
