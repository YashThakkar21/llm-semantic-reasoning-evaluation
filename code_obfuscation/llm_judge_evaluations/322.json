      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: the function should calculate the area of a tetrahedron, which mathematically is (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2 for edge length a. The obfuscated raw solution is `return math.sqrt(3)*(x7z_9*x7z_9)`, which is actually 4 times the correct formula, but semantically it's still 'area of a tetrahedron as a function of side length'. Qwen's description: 'Calculates the square root of 3 times the square of a variable named x7z_9.' This is just a literal description of the expression and does not connect it to the concept of a tetrahedron or area. It correctly reflects the arithmetic operation but completely misses the semantic intent (area of a tetrahedron given side length). Thus, semantic accuracy is low (it only matches the math form, not the problem intent), and completeness is also low because it omits any mention of geometry, tetrahedron, or input/output meaning.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of side lengths of tetrahedrons, compute the total area of all tetrahedrons. The obfuscated new solution defines a function that iterates over a list, calls `area_tetrahedron` on each element, and sums the results. Qwen's description: 'Computes the total area of tetrahedrons given a list of values, where each value is used to calculate the area of a tetrahedron using the function area_tetrahedron.' This matches the ground truth very well: it identifies that the input is a list, that each element is used as the argument to an area function for a tetrahedron, and that the result is the total area. It captures the core purpose, the input/output, and the algorithm (map via area_tetrahedron + sum). Both semantic accuracy and completeness are therefore high.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from 'compute area of a single tetrahedron given its side length' to 'given a list of side lengths, compute the sum of their areas using the single-tetrahedron function'. Qwen's raw description failed to identify the geometric/semantic meaning of the base function, but in the new problem it correctly recognized that the higher-level function is computing 'total area of tetrahedrons' from a list via `area_tetrahedron`. So it did understand the structural transformation: the new function aggregates repeated applications of the base function over a list. However, because its raw description is purely algebraic and not tied to tetrahedrons, its understanding of the relationship between the two problem statements is only partially aligned with the ground truth. It got the structural relationship (use base function on each element and sum) but not the conceptual evolution from 'area of one tetrahedron' to 'total area of many tetrahedrons'. Hence a good but not perfect score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mainly in variable names like `x7z_9` and `j3_k9m2_l4`, but the presence of a clearly named helper `area_tetrahedron` in the new solution gives away the semantics. In the raw solution, there is no such semantic hint; it's just a single expression. Qwen defaulted to a purely syntactic description for the raw function, indicating that without semantic cues in names or comments it did not infer the geometric meaning from the formula alone. In the new solution, Qwen relied heavily on the function name `area_tetrahedron` and the loop structure to infer that the list elements are side lengths of tetrahedrons and that the result is a total area. This shows moderate robustness: it can overcome obfuscated variable names when there is at least one meaningful identifier and clear control flow, but it does not infer deeper semantics from a bare mathematical expression with obfuscated parameter names.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately described the new problem as computing the total area of tetrahedrons from a list using a helper function.",
        "Correctly identified the input type (list), the per-element operation (call area_tetrahedron), and the aggregation (sum).",
        "Captured the structural transformation from a single-value function to a list-aggregating function."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to recognize that the raw expression is intended to represent the area of a tetrahedron; only restated the arithmetic.",
        "Did not connect the raw function's semantics (area of one tetrahedron) to the new function's semantics (total area of many tetrahedrons).",
        "Relied on the helper function name `area_tetrahedron` rather than inferring semantics from the mathematical formula in the raw solution."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates that it can understand higher-level semantics when there is at least one informative identifier and some structural context (loop + helper function). However, when presented with a bare numeric expression and an obfuscated parameter name, it defaults to a literal description of the computation rather than inferring the intended domain meaning (geometry, tetrahedron area). This suggests its semantic understanding is strongly anchored in naming and structural cues rather than in recognizing mathematical formulas as domain-specific operations. The contrast between the weak raw-problem interpretation and the strong new-problem interpretation highlights this dependency: once `area_tetrahedron` appears, Qwen immediately frames the task in geometric terms, but it does not retroactively apply that understanding to the raw function description."
