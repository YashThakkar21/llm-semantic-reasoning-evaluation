      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is: compute the sum of products of all possible contiguous sublists (subarrays) of a given list. The obfuscated code implements the known O(n) DP formula for this: iterating from the end, maintaining a partial sum q2z_7w where q2z_7w = last_element * (1 + previous_q2z_7w), and accumulating that into a8f3_9x. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates a cumulative sum based on a recursive formula applied to elements of a list, modifying the list in place by removing elements from the end.\" This is semantically close to what the code is doing at the operational level: it recognizes a cumulative sum, a recursive-like formula, and that elements are removed from the end. However, it does not identify that the cumulative sum corresponds specifically to the sum of products of all possible subarrays. So Qwen understood the mechanics (recursive formula, cumulative sum, in-place modification) but not the higher-level semantic intent. Hence relatively high semantic accuracy for the code behavior itself (4), but only moderate completeness (3) because it misses the key notion of \"all possible sublists\" and their products.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem generalizes the raw one: given a list of lists, for each inner list compute the sum of products of all possible sublists (as in the raw problem), then sum those results. The obfuscated new solution simply iterates over b3x_6q (the outer list) and accumulates v4n_2p += d7s_4m(h8j_1t), where d7s_4m is clearly the function implementing the raw logic for a single list. Qwen's new problem description: \"The code computes the total sum of values returned by applying a function `d7s_4m` to each element in the list `b3x_6q`.\" This is only a very generic description of the loop structure; it does not connect d7s_4m to the earlier semantics (sum of products of all sublists), nor mention that the elements of b3x_6q are themselves lists, nor that the overall task is to sum those per-list subarray-product sums. Thus, while Qwen correctly describes the superficial control flow (map-then-sum pattern), it misses the core semantic meaning of what d7s_4m does and what the overall problem is. That yields low semantic accuracy (2) and very low completeness (1).",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: lift the single-list operation (sum of products of all sublists) to a list-of-lists by applying the same operation to each inner list and summing the results. Qwen's raw description captures that the raw function is some cumulative recursive formula over a list. Its new description captures that the new function sums d7s_4m applied to each element of b3x_6q. However, Qwen does not explicitly connect that d7s_4m is the previously described function, nor that the elements are themselves lists, nor that the new problem is a higher-order aggregation of the same operation. It understands the structural transformation (\"apply a function to each element and sum\") but not the semantic transformation (\"lift the subarray-product-sum operation from one list to many\"). Hence a low-to-moderate score (2) for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names, Qwen correctly inferred several structural aspects of the raw code: it recognized a cumulative sum, a recursive-style update formula, and that the list is modified by popping from the end. This shows some robustness to obfuscation at the control-flow and data-flow level. However, it did not infer the higher-level mathematical meaning (sum of products of all subarrays), which requires recognizing the known DP pattern q = a[i] * (1 + q) and its relation to subarray products. For the new code, Qwen again correctly identified the high-level pattern (sum of function applications over a list) but did not connect that to the earlier semantics or to the fact that the elements are sublists. Overall, Qwen handled the obfuscation well enough to describe the mechanics but not well enough to recover the original problem semantics, leading to a mid-range robustness score (3).",

        "Correctly identified that the raw function computes a cumulative sum using a recursive-like formula over the list elements.",

        "For the new code, correctly recognized the pattern of summing the results of applying a function to each element of a list.",
        "Showed reliance on control-flow and update rules rather than variable names, indicating some robustness to obfuscation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to identify the core semantic goal of the raw function: computing the sum of products of all possible subarrays.",
        "Did not mention that the raw algorithm corresponds to a known DP formula for subarray-product sums.",
        "In the new problem, did not recognize that the list elements are themselves lists and that d7s_4m is the raw-problem function.",
        "Did not articulate the semantic relationship between raw and new problems (lifting the operation from one list to a list-of-lists).",
        "Descriptions remained at a structural level and missed key problem-level concepts like \"subarrays\", \"products\", and \"sum over all sublists\"."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a decent ability to parse and describe the operational behavior of obfuscated code—identifying cumulative updates, recursive-like formulas, and iteration patterns—without relying on variable names. However, it struggles to bridge from operational semantics to the higher-level mathematical or algorithmic intent, especially when that intent corresponds to a known pattern (sum of products of all subarrays). In the multi-function setting (raw vs. new), Qwen can see that one function aggregates the results of another but does not clearly track or restate the underlying semantics across functions. This suggests that while its control-flow understanding is solid, its abstraction to problem-level descriptions and its ability to recognize known algorithmic idioms from code are limited in this example."
