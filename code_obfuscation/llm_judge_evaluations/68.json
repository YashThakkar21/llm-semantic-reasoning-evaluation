      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's description of the raw problem matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is: \"Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.\" Qwen inferred: \"The code calculates the sum of all amicable numbers up to a given limit. Amicable numbers are pairs of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.\" This not only captures the same input/output behavior (sum of all amicable numbers up to a limit) but also correctly explains what amicable numbers are, which is an extra, accurate detail derived from the divisor-sum helper. The code snippet confirms this: `w8_m(k5_l)` iterates from 2 to k5_l, computes `div_sum` twice to check the amicable condition, stores amicable numbers in a set, and returns their sum. Qwen's semantic understanding is fully aligned with the actual behavior.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: \"Write a function to find the sum of all amicable numbers within multiple ranges provided as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the start and end of a range. The function should return the total sum of amicable numbers found across all ranges.\" Qwen inferred: \"The code computes the total sum of amicable numbers within specified ranges provided as pairs in a list.\" This is semantically identical: it recognizes that the input is a list of (start, end) pairs and the output is the total sum of amicable numbers across those ranges. The obfuscated code `for u8_j, y3_w in x7_s: f1_d += w8_m(y3_w) - w8_m(u8_j - 1)` shows that for each range it uses the prefix-sum-like property of `w8_m` to get the sum within [u8_j, y3_w]. Qwen correctly abstracts this as \"within specified ranges\" and \"total sum\". No important detail from the ground truth is missing or contradicted.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from summing amicable numbers up to a single limit to summing amicable numbers over multiple ranges, using the original function as a building block. Qwen's raw and new descriptions reflect exactly this evolution: first, a single-limit sum; then, a list of ranges (pairs) and a total sum over them. The new solution code uses `w8_m` in a difference form `w8_m(y3_w) - w8_m(u8_j - 1)` to get range sums, which Qwen implicitly understands by describing the behavior at the problem level rather than the implementation trick. This shows it correctly grasped that the new problem generalizes the original one to multiple intervals and aggregates the results. Hence, its understanding of the relationship between raw and new problems is complete and correct.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `w8_m`, `q9_z`, `k5_l`, `x7_s`, Qwen inferred the correct semantics by following the control flow and arithmetic rather than relying on identifiers. It recognized that `div_sum` (shown only by body) computes the sum of proper divisors, that `w8_m` uses this to detect amicable pairs and sum them, and that the new function iterates over a list of (start, end) pairs and uses prefix sums to get range sums. The mention of the formal definition of amicable numbers indicates it correctly reverse-engineered the mathematical intent from the double application of `div_sum`. This demonstrates strong robustness to obfuscation: the model relied on structural and numerical logic, not names.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely matched the core task for the raw problem: sum of all amicable numbers up to a limit.",
        "Accurately described the mathematical definition of amicable numbers from the code.",
        "Correctly identified that the new problem operates on multiple ranges given as pairs in a list.",
        "Captured that the new function returns the total sum across all ranges, not per-range results.",
        "Showed clear understanding of the relationship between the original single-limit function and the range-based extension.",
        "Demonstrated independence from variable naming, relying on algorithmic structure instead."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention that the implementation uses a prefix-sum trick (w8_m(end) - w8_m(start-1)), though this is an implementation detail rather than a problem-spec requirement.",
        "Did not specify that the range boundaries are inclusive, again a minor detail inferred from code but not stated in the description."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen's performance on this problem shows that it can robustly infer nontrivial mathematical semantics (amicable numbers via proper divisor sums) from obfuscated code and then correctly generalize that understanding to a higher-level problem transformation (single-limit sum to multi-range sum). Its descriptions align very closely with the ground truth and even add a correct formal definition of amicable numbers, indicating deep semantic parsing of the helper functions and control flow rather than shallow pattern matching on names."
