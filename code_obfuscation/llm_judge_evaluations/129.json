      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the sum of squares of the first n odd natural numbers. The closed form for this is n(2n−1)(2n+1)/3 = n(4n^2−1)/3, which is exactly what the obfuscated code implements. Qwen instead describes this as computing the nth centered square number (a figurate number sequence). While the same formula indeed defines the nth centered square number, Qwen's description is in terms of figurate geometry rather than the intended combinatorial interpretation (sum of squares of first n odds). So Qwen correctly identifies the mathematical sequence produced by the formula, but not the semantic intent expressed in the ground truth problem. It misses the explicit notion of 'sum of squares of first n odd natural numbers' and instead reinterprets the function as a direct formula for centered square numbers. Hence, it is partially semantically accurate (the numeric mapping n → value is correct) but conceptually misaligned with the original problem statement.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of integers, for each n compute the sum of squares of the first n odd natural numbers, then return the sum over all these per-n sums. The obfuscated code `return sum(square_Sum(n) for n in lst)` matches this: it calls the original function for each n and sums the results. Qwen's new description: 'Computes the sum of centered square numbers for each element in the list `lst`.' This mirrors its earlier reinterpretation: it treats the inner function as producing centered square numbers and the outer function as summing them. Structurally, Qwen correctly understands that the function maps each list element through the original numeric function and sums the results. However, it again mislabels the underlying quantity: it should be 'sum of sums of squares of first n odd numbers', not 'sum of centered square numbers'. So the algorithmic structure and input/output behavior are captured, but the semantic description of what is being summed is off relative to the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a scalar function f(n) to lists by computing sum(f(n_i)) over all n_i in the list. Qwen's descriptions reflect this transformation well. In the raw problem, it says we compute the nth centered square number. In the new problem, it says we compute the sum of those centered square numbers for each element in the list. This is exactly the structural change in the code: from `f(n)` to `sum(f(n) for n in lst)`. So while Qwen misinterprets the original semantic intent (sum of squares of odd numbers vs centered square numbers), it consistently tracks how the new problem is derived from the old one: lifting a scalar numeric sequence function to a list and summing the results. Thus, its understanding of the transformation is strong even though the base semantic label is wrong.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated raw code is a single formula `n * (4 * n * n - 1) / 3`, with no helpful names. Qwen correctly recognizes this as the formula for centered square numbers, which is mathematically valid and nontrivial. However, the ground truth problem is about the sum of squares of the first n odd natural numbers, whose closed form coincides with the centered square numbers. To match the ground truth, Qwen would have needed to infer the intended combinatorial interpretation rather than just identify the known sequence. Given only the formula and no loop or explicit odd-number summation, it is understandable that Qwen latched onto the figurate-number interpretation. This shows good robustness to obfuscation at the level of recognizing the numeric sequence from the formula, but weaker robustness in reconstructing the original high-level problem statement when the implementation is already in closed form. For the new problem, Qwen correctly interprets the higher-order structure (`sum(f(n) for n in lst)`) despite obfuscated naming, indicating it relies on code structure rather than names.",

        "Fails to match the intended semantic description from the ground truth: 'sum of squares of the first n odd natural numbers'.",
        "Describes the function in terms of figurate numbers rather than the combinatorial sum that the original problem specifies.",
        "Carries the initial misinterpretation into the new problem, so both raw and new problem descriptions are consistently but semantically misaligned with the dataset's intent.",
        "Does not mention the relationship between the formula and the underlying sum-of-odd-squares process, missing an important explanatory bridge."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong ability to recognize mathematical sequences from closed-form expressions and to track structural transformations from scalar to list-based problems, even when code is obfuscated. However, when the implementation is already in a compact mathematical form, it tends to describe the function in terms of the most salient known sequence (centered square numbers) rather than reconstructing the original procedural or combinatorial interpretation (sum of squares of first n odd numbers). This leads to a semantic mismatch with the ground truth problem statement, despite numerical equivalence. The model is robust to obfuscation in terms of understanding control/data flow and high-level transformations, but less robust in inferring the original narrative intent behind a closed-form implementation."
