      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's description of the raw problem matches the ground truth semantics very closely. The ground truth is: \"find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in the given list.\" Qwen says: \"calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array, resetting the sum to zero if it becomes negative.\" This correctly identifies: (1) input: a 1D array/list, (2) task: maximum sum over all contiguous subarrays, (3) algorithm: Kadane's algorithm with reset to zero when the running sum becomes negative. The only minor omission is that it doesn't explicitly restate that the function returns that maximum sum as the output, but that is strongly implied. Hence semantic accuracy is perfect, while completeness is slightly less than perfect due to not mentioning edge cases (e.g., all-negative arrays) or return behavior explicitly.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth: \"Given a 2D list (matrix) of integers, find the sum of the largest contiguous submatrix. A submatrix is defined as any rectangular subarray of the given matrix.\" Qwen's inference: \"finds the maximum sum of a submatrix within a two-dimensional matrix by considering all possible pairs of rows and applying a 1D maximum subarray sum algorithm on the collapsed row sums.\" This is fully aligned with the ground truth: (1) input: 2D matrix of integers, (2) task: maximum sum over all rectangular submatrices, (3) algorithm: iterate over all pairs of rows, collapse them into a 1D array of column sums, then apply the 1D max subarray algorithm. It also implicitly captures that the submatrix is rectangular. Qwen even describes the algorithmic strategy used in the obfuscated code. It misses only trivial implementation details like the explicit handling of empty matrices returning 0, but the problem statement itself doesn't emphasize that, so completeness relative to the problem description is effectively full.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is from 1D maximum subarray sum to 2D maximum submatrix sum using the 1D algorithm as a subroutine. Qwen clearly understood this relationship: in the new problem description it explicitly states that the 2D algorithm works \"by considering all possible pairs of rows and applying a 1D maximum subarray sum algorithm on the collapsed row sums.\" This shows it recognized that the new solution reuses the raw solution's logic (Kadane) as a building block. It correctly captures that the raw problem is the core primitive and the new problem generalizes it to two dimensions. Thus, its understanding of the raw→new transformation is accurate and complete.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated variable names (e.g., a8_zQ, x3_Rw9, p4_Lk, w2_Yx7, j1_Zr6), Qwen correctly inferred the high-level semantics purely from control flow and operations. In the raw solution, it recognized the classic Kadane pattern: running sum, reset to zero when negative, track maximum. In the new solution, it correctly interpreted the nested loops over row indices, the accumulation into a temporary array representing column-wise sums, and the call to max_sub_array_sum as the 1D Kadane subroutine. This indicates that Qwen relied on structural patterns and algorithmic templates rather than variable names, demonstrating strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified the raw problem as the maximum sum contiguous subarray (Kadane's algorithm).",
        "Correctly captured the new problem as maximum sum submatrix in a 2D matrix using row-pair compression and 1D Kadane.",
        "Explicitly described the algorithmic strategy for the 2D case, including row-pair iteration and collapsed row sums.",
        "Recognized and articulated the relationship between the raw and new problems: the 2D problem builds on the 1D solution.",
        "Showed no reliance on variable naming; understanding was driven by control flow and arithmetic patterns."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention return values or edge-case behavior (e.g., empty matrix returns 0) in the descriptions.",
        "Did not discuss potential nuances like handling all-negative arrays in the 1D case, which can be a subtle point for Kadane-style implementations."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of classic algorithmic patterns even under heavy name obfuscation. It not only recognized Kadane's algorithm in 1D but also correctly interpreted the standard 2D maximum submatrix technique that leverages Kadane as a subroutine. Its description of the transformation from the raw to the new problem shows it can see how a base algorithm is generalized to higher dimensions. The minor omissions are about explicit mention of return values and edge cases rather than misunderstanding of the core logic, indicating that its reasoning is structurally and algorithmically sound."
