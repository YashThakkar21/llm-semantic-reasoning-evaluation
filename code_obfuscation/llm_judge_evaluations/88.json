Obfuscated code: `[x7g_2q for x7g_2q in m9_list3a if x7g_2q not in b4_lst9z]`. Qwen's description: 'filters out elements from m9_list3a that are present in b4_lst9z, returning a list of unique elements from m9_list3a not found in b4_lst9z.' Semantically, Qwen correctly captures the core behavior: it filters one list based on membership in another and returns the remaining elements. The only inaccuracy is the mention of 'unique elements', which is not guaranteed by the code (it preserves duplicates). That’s a minor but real semantic error. Otherwise, inputs, outputs, and main operation are correctly understood. Completeness is high: it mentions both lists and the filtering condition, but it does not explicitly note that order and multiplicity are preserved, and it slightly overstates uniqueness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: given a list of lists, remove all elements from each sublist that are present in a given exclusion list, returning a new list of lists with excluded elements removed. Obfuscated code: `return [v8q_func2x(k3_sub7l, p0_excl9m) for k3_sub7l in r2_lstlst8 if True]`. From the ground truth, we know v8q_func2x is the element-removal function applied to each sublist. Qwen's description: 'applies the function v8q_func2x to each element in r2_lstlst8, using p0_excl9m as a second argument, and returns a list of the results.' Qwen correctly identifies the high-level structure: mapping a two-argument function over a list with a fixed second argument and returning the list of results. However, it does not infer or state the semantic purpose of v8q_func2x (removing excluded elements from each sublist) or that r2_lstlst8 is a list of lists. It treats this as a generic higher-order application rather than a specific filtering-by-exclusion task. Thus semantic accuracy is partial (correct about structure, missing the core domain meaning), and completeness is low because it omits the key idea of per-sublist element removal based on an exclusion list.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: extend a single-list filtering function to operate over a list of lists by applying it to each sublist with a shared exclusion list, returning a list of filtered sublists. Qwen's raw description recognizes the raw function as a filter based on membership in another list (though it incorrectly adds 'unique'). For the new problem, Qwen recognizes that the new solution applies a function to each element of a list with a fixed second argument and collects results. However, Qwen does not explicitly connect that v8q_func2x is the same kind of filtering function as in the raw problem, nor that the new problem is a lifted/iterated version of the original over sublists. It captures the syntactic transformation (map a function over a list) but misses the semantic transformation (from filtering a flat list to filtering each sublist of a list of lists using the same exclusion list). Hence, understanding of the transformation is moderate but not complete.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names, Qwen correctly inferred the semantics of the raw code: it saw the list comprehension with a membership test and understood it as filtering one list by excluding elements found in another. This shows good reliance on code structure rather than variable names. For the new code, Qwen correctly recognized the pattern of a list comprehension that applies a function to each element of a list with an additional fixed argument. However, it did not infer the deeper semantics of v8q_func2x from context or from the relationship to the raw problem; it stayed at a structural description. The obfuscation likely contributed to this, as the function name gives no hint, and the body of v8q_func2x was not shown. Overall, Qwen handled obfuscation well for the simple raw snippet, but for the composed new snippet it defaulted to a generic description instead of inferring the intended higher-level behavior.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrectly described the raw result as 'unique elements', which is not implied by the code and misstates the handling of duplicates.",
        "Did not capture that r2_lstlst8 is a list of lists and that each element is a sublist to be filtered.",
        "Failed to infer or state the semantic role of v8q_func2x as the exclusion-based filter from the raw problem, treating it as a generic function instead.",
        "Did not explicitly articulate the semantic transformation from filtering a single list to filtering each sublist in a list of lists with a shared exclusion list."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong pattern recognition for basic list-processing constructs even under obfuscated naming, accurately interpreting the raw list comprehension's filtering behavior. However, when the problem is composed into a higher-order pattern (mapping a previously defined filter over a list of lists), Qwen's description becomes more generic and loses the domain-specific semantics (removing excluded elements from each sublist). This suggests that while Qwen can robustly parse and describe local code structure, it is less consistent at tracking and reusing semantic roles of functions across related snippets, especially when names are obfuscated and the function body is not directly visible. The small but notable error about 'unique elements' also indicates a tendency to overgeneralize common patterns (filtering vs. deduplication) without strict grounding in the exact code behavior."
