      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: convert a complex number to polar coordinates using cmath. Qwen's inference: \"The code converts a complex number into its polar coordinates using the cmath module.\" This matches exactly: it identifies the input (a complex number), the operation (conversion to polar coordinates), the output (polar coordinates), and the use of cmath. There are no missing nuances or inaccuracies for such a simple function.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of complex numbers, compute the average distance from the origin in polar coordinates, where distance is the magnitude r from the polar form. Qwen's inference: \"The code calculates the average distance (magnitude) of a list of complex numbers from the origin.\" This captures all essential semantics: it recognizes the input as a list of complex numbers, the operation of computing magnitudes (distance from origin), and taking their average. The reference to polar coordinates is implicit via 'magnitude', which is correct and sufficient, especially given the code snippet `convert(n_um)[0]` (taking the r component from a polar conversion). No important detail is missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: single complex → list of complex numbers, and from returning polar coordinates to aggregating the magnitudes (r) and returning their average. Qwen's descriptions reflect this evolution correctly: the raw problem is about converting to polar coordinates; the new problem is about using that conversion (or at least the magnitude concept) over a list and averaging the distances. Qwen implicitly understands that the new problem builds on the raw one by using the magnitude from the polar representation, even though it doesn't explicitly mention 'polar form' in the new description. The relationship between the two problems is correctly captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `d1st4nc3s`, `convert`, and `c0mpl3x_numb3rs`, Qwen correctly inferred that `convert(n_um)[0]` is obtaining a magnitude (r) from a polar conversion and that the list comprehension followed by `sum(...) / len(...)` computes an average distance. The raw snippet `return cmath.polar(numbers)` is straightforward, but the new snippet requires understanding that the first element of the tuple returned by `convert` is the distance. Qwen did not rely on variable names; instead, it used structural and library semantics (cmath.polar returns (r, phi)) to infer the correct behavior, demonstrating strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfect semantic match to the ground truth for the raw problem, including correct mention of cmath and polar coordinates.",
        "Accurate identification of the new problem as computing the average magnitude of a list of complex numbers from the origin.",
        "Correct implicit understanding that the first element of the polar tuple is the distance, and that the code is aggregating these distances.",
        "Clear grasp of the transformation from a single conversion to an aggregate statistic (average) over a list.",
        "Did not get misled by obfuscated variable names and instead relied on code structure and known library behavior."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The new problem description does not explicitly mention 'polar coordinates' even though the ground truth emphasizes that the distance is the r from the polar form; however, this is more a stylistic omission than a semantic error."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated that it can accurately infer the semantics of code that uses standard library functions like cmath.polar, even when wrapped in obfuscated naming. It correctly recognized both the base operation (complex → polar) and the higher-level aggregation (average magnitude over a list), and it understood the conceptual link between the two problems. This indicates strong reliance on structural and API semantics rather than variable naming, and shows that it can track how a simple function is reused in a more complex context."
