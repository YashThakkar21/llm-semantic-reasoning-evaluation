      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description — \"The code calculates the sum of the digits of the number obtained by raising a base to a given power\" — matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth states: \"Write a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power.\" Qwen correctly identifies: (1) the inputs (a base and a power), (2) the operation (raise base to power), and (3) the final step (sum the digits of the resulting number). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations. The description is concise but fully accurate.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen's description — \"The code aggregates the sum of the digits of numbers obtained by raising multiple bases to their respective powers, as provided in a list of tuples\" — aligns perfectly with the ground truth: \"takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a base and a power, and calculates the sum of all digits of the base raised to the specified power for each tuple in the list. Finally, return the total sum of all these sums.\" Qwen captures: (1) the input structure (list of tuples), (2) the per-tuple operation (raise base to its power, sum digits), and (3) the aggregation (total sum over all tuples). It correctly understands that the result is the sum of the individual digit-sums, not something else like concatenation or per-tuple outputs. The description is complete and semantically precise.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a single (base, power) computation to a list of (base, power) pairs and aggregate the results. Qwen's raw problem description focuses on a single base-power pair, and its new problem description explicitly generalizes this to multiple pairs in a list of tuples and aggregates their digit sums. This mirrors the ground truth evolution exactly. It implicitly understands that the new solution reuses the original functionality (via `power_base_sum`) inside a loop over the list and then sums the results. Thus, Qwen demonstrates a correct understanding of how the new problem builds on and generalizes the original one.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names like `a7x_9q`, `b3z_m`, and `p8w_k`, Qwen correctly inferred the semantics from the code structure: iterating over `tuples_list`, unpacking each tuple into two values, calling `power_base_sum` with those values, accumulating into `a7x_9q`, and returning it. It did not rely on names to infer meaning; instead, it used the control flow and function calls to reconstruct the high-level behavior. Similarly, in the raw solution, it correctly interpreted `pow(base, power)`, string conversion, and digit summation. This indicates strong robustness to naming obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the core semantics of the raw problem (single base and power, sum of digits of base^power).",
        "Accurately described the new problem as an aggregation over a list of (base, power) tuples.",
        "Correctly identified the input types and structures (arguments vs. list of tuples).",
        "Recognized the aggregation pattern (total sum of per-tuple digit sums).",
        "Showed no dependence on variable names, instead relying on code structure and operations."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Descriptions are high-level and do not explicitly mention minor implementation details (e.g., use of `pow`, string conversion), though these are not required by the problem statement.",
        "Does not explicitly state that the function returns a single integer result in both cases, though this is strongly implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a near-perfect understanding of the code's semantics, even with obfuscated identifiers. It cleanly abstracts from implementation to problem-level description and correctly tracks the evolution from a single-instance computation to a batched, aggregated version. This example suggests that Qwen relies primarily on control flow, data flow, and standard library semantics rather than variable naming, which is exactly the desired behavior for robust code understanding under obfuscation."
