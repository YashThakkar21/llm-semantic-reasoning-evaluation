      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: extract the nth element from a given list of tuples. Code: `return [x[n] for x in l1st1]`. Qwen's description: 'extracts the nth element from each sublist in a list of lists.' Semantically, Qwen recognizes that the code is indexing into each element of a sequence and collecting the nth component, but it misidentifies the data structure: the original problem is about tuples, not sublists, and the input is a single list, not a list of lists. So the core idea of 'nth element from each item' is partially captured, but the container types and structure are wrong. Hence low but non-zero accuracy and completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: Given a list of lists of tuples, extract the nth element from each tuple in each sublist and return a list of lists of those elements. Code: `return [e3tr4ct_nth_3l3m3nt(s8bl1st, n) for s8bl1st in l1st_0f_l1sts]`, where the helper presumably does the per-tuple extraction. Qwen's description: 'extracts the nth element from each sublist in a list of lists using a function named e3tr4ct_nth_3l3m3nt.' This misses that the nth element is taken from each tuple inside each sublist, not from the sublist itself. It also omits that the output is a list of lists mirroring the input structure. Qwen does notice the function name and the list-of-lists structure, but its semantics are off by one level and ignore tuples. Thus only partial semantic accuracy and completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: extend from a flat list of tuples to a nested list of lists of tuples, and correspondingly from a flat list of extracted elements to a nested list of lists of extracted elements. Qwen's raw problem already mis-framed the input as a list of lists, so its new problem description does not clearly express the evolution from single-level to two-level structure, nor the shift from tuples to lists-of-tuples. It only adds that a function named e3tr4ct_nth_3l3m3nt is used, without articulating the structural generalization. This shows limited understanding of the transformation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mild (weird variable names and leetspeak in the function name). The core logic is straightforward list comprehension and function application. Qwen correctly inferred that something is being extracted by index n across elements, and that the outer structure in the new solution is a list of lists. However, it appears to have relied on generic 'sublist' terminology and did not pay attention to the original problem's mention of tuples, nor did it infer from the helper function's likely behavior that it operates on inner sequences (tuples) rather than on the sublists themselves. The robustness score is slightly higher than the semantic scores because Qwen did not get confused by the obfuscated names, but it still failed to capture the precise data structures and nesting semantics.",
      "strengths": [
        "Identified that the core operation involves extracting the nth element via indexing across a collection.",
        "Recognized that the new solution operates over a list of lists and uses a helper function to perform the extraction.",
        "Was not thrown off by obfuscated variable and function names; still recognized the high-level pattern of mapping an index-based extraction over a collection."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mischaracterized the data structures: tuples were described as sublists, losing an important aspect of the ground truth.",
        "Misunderstood the level at which the nth element is extracted in the new problem (from sublists instead of from tuples within sublists).",
        "Did not clearly state the input-output relationship in terms of preserving the nested list-of-lists structure.",
        "Failed to articulate the transformation from a flat list of tuples to a nested list of lists of tuples and the corresponding nested output."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen captured the general pattern of 'apply index n across elements of a collection' but was imprecise about the exact data structures and nesting levels. This suggests that while it can follow simple comprehension patterns even with obfuscated names, it may default to vague terms like 'sublist' and overlook distinctions such as tuple vs. list or element vs. container level. For evaluating semantic understanding, this highlights a tendency to approximate the behavior rather than precisely mirror the problem specification, especially regarding input structure and output shape."
