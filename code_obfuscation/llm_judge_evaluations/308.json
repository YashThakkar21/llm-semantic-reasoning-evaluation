      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is: extract values between double quotes from a given string. The obfuscated code is `re.findall(r'\"(.*?)\"', x9z_2Q)`. Qwen's description: \"The code extracts all substrings enclosed in double quotes from the string variable x9z_2Q.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it identifies that the function returns all substrings between double quotes, and correctly identifies the input as a string. It also implicitly captures that the result is a list of such substrings. There are no missing constraints or nuances in the raw problem, so Qwen's description is both semantically accurate and complete relative to the ground truth.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: given a list of strings, apply the quote-extraction logic to each string and return a list of lists, where each sublist contains the extracted values for the corresponding string. The obfuscated code is `return [b7_mK3(w2_vR) for w2_vR in p4_aL9s]`. Here, `b7_mK3` is presumably the raw-problem function (extract quotes from a single string), and `p4_aL9s` is the list of strings. Qwen's description: \"The code applies the function b7_mK3 to each element in the iterable p4_aL9s, returning a list of the results.\" This is a generic description of a list comprehension mapping a function over an iterable. It correctly captures the structural operation (map a function over an iterable and collect results in a list) but completely misses the semantic content that b7_mK3 is the quote-extraction function and that the input elements are strings. It also omits the important detail that the output is a list of lists of extracted substrings. Thus, semantic accuracy is low (it only gets the mapping pattern right), and completeness is very low because it omits all domain-specific semantics present in the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: lift a scalar operation (extract quotes from one string) to a collection-level operation (apply it to each string in a list and aggregate the per-string results). Qwen's new-problem description recognizes that the new code applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a list of results, which partially reflects the transformation from single input to multiple inputs. However, Qwen does not connect this back to the original semantics (quote extraction) and does not state that the function being applied is the previously defined extraction function. It also does not mention that the resulting structure is a list of lists corresponding to each original string. So Qwen understands the syntactic transformation (scalar → mapped over iterable) but not the semantic continuity between the two problems. Hence, the transformation understanding is only partial.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mild: variable and function names like `x9z_2Q`, `b7_mK3`, and `p4_aL9s` are meaningless. For the raw problem, Qwen relied correctly on the regex pattern and `re.findall` behavior, not on names, and produced an accurate semantic description. This shows good robustness to obfuscation in that context. For the new problem, Qwen correctly inferred the control structure of the list comprehension and that `p4_aL9s` is an iterable, again not relying on names. However, it failed to infer or state that `b7_mK3` is the previously defined quote-extraction function. This is less about obfuscation and more about not propagating semantic knowledge from the raw solution to the new one. Structurally, Qwen handled obfuscation well; semantically, it did not integrate the earlier understanding into the new context.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified the purpose of the regex and `re.findall` in the raw solution as extracting substrings between double quotes.",
        "Correctly recognized the list comprehension pattern in the new solution as applying a function to each element of an iterable and collecting results.",
        "Did not depend on variable names to understand the raw code; instead used the regex and library call semantics.",
        "Captured the correct input type (a string) and output behavior (all substrings in quotes) for the raw problem."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "For the new problem, failed to mention that the function being applied is specifically the quote-extraction function defined in the raw problem.",
        "Did not state that the input iterable is a list of strings, nor that the output is a list of lists of extracted substrings.",
        "Did not articulate the semantic relationship between the raw and new problems (lifting a scalar operation to a list-level operation).",
        "New-problem description is overly generic and loses the domain-specific semantics present in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong ability to understand localized code semantics even under obfuscated naming, as seen in the precise interpretation of the regex-based extraction in the raw problem. It also correctly recognizes structural patterns like list comprehensions and mapping a function over an iterable. However, it does not automatically carry over or re-attach previously inferred semantics (that b7_mK3 extracts quoted substrings) when analyzing the new code. This leads to a generic but structurally correct description for the new problem that misses the core semantic transformation (from single-string extraction to list-of-strings extraction). The main limitation here is not robustness to obfuscation per se, but limited integration of semantic context across related code snippets."
