      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the nth centered hexagonal number. The mathematical formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is indeed 3*n*(n-1) + 1. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates a specific mathematical expression, returning the result of 3 times n times (n minus 1) plus 1.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly identifies the exact computation performed by the code, but it does not connect this expression to its mathematical meaning (centered hexagonal number). So it understands what the code does at the level of operations and input/output, but not the higher-level concept. Hence medium semantic accuracy and low completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of integers (positions/indices), compute the centered hexagonal number for each and return the sum of those values. Obfuscated code: defines a function a8x_2q9z(b3_m7) that returns 3*b3_m7*(b3_m7-1)+1, then returns sum(a8x_2q9z(k9_w4r) for k9_w4r in f5_t8j). Qwen's description: \"The code defines a function to compute a specific mathematical expression for a given input and then sums the results of applying this function to each element in a collection named f5_t8j.\" This is a very accurate operational description: it captures that there is a helper function, that it is applied to each element of a collection, and that the results are summed. It again misses the semantic label that this expression represents a centered hexagonal number and that the list elements are positions/indices on a hexagonal grid. So semantic accuracy is high at the code/algorithm level but not at the problem-domain level; completeness is moderate because it omits the domain context and the nature of the input list.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is: compute a single nth centered hexagonal number. The new problem is: given a list of such n values, compute the sum of their centered hexagonal numbers. Qwen's raw description focuses on computing the expression for a single n; its new description correctly identifies that the new code defines the same expression as a helper function and then sums its application over all elements in a collection. This shows it understood the structural transformation: from a scalar computation to mapping the same formula over a collection and aggregating via sum. It does not explicitly articulate that the new problem is \"sum of centered hexagonal numbers\" or that the list elements are positions on a hex grid, but it clearly captures the computational relationship between raw and new. Thus, the understanding of the transformation is good at the algorithmic level, though not at the domain-label level.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The variable and function names (a8x_2q9z, b3_m7, k9_w4r, f5_t8j) are meaningless, yet Qwen correctly inferred the control/data flow: a helper function takes one argument, computes 3*x*(x-1)+1, and the outer expression sums this over all elements of f5_t8j. This indicates Qwen relied on the syntactic and structural aspects of the code (function definition, generator expression, sum) rather than on names. Its description of the new solution is fully consistent with the actual logic despite obfuscation. The only missing piece is the higher-level mathematical interpretation, which is not encoded in the code structure or names anyway. So robustness to obfuscation is very strong.",

        "Precisely described the mathematical expression 3*n*(n-1)+1 implemented in the raw solution.",
        "Correctly recognized that the new solution defines a helper function and then sums its application over a collection.",
        "Accurately captured the input-output behavior at the code level for both raw and new problems.",
        "Showed no reliance on variable or function names, instead using code structure to infer behavior."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to identify that the expression corresponds to the nth centered hexagonal number, missing the core mathematical concept.",
        "Did not mention the domain context of a hexagonal grid or positions of points, which is part of the ground truth description.",
        "New problem description omits that the input is a list of integers representing positions/indices and that the sum is of centered hexagonal numbers, not just arbitrary expression values."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong syntactic and structural understanding of the obfuscated Python code: it correctly identifies the operations, data flow, and aggregation patterns even when names are meaningless. Its descriptions are accurate at the level of \"what computation is performed\" but do not bridge to the higher-level mathematical or domain semantics (centered hexagonal numbers, hexagonal grid) that are not explicitly encoded in the code. This suggests that, given only obfuscated code, Qwen is reliable for reconstructing algorithmic behavior and transformations (e.g., from single-value computation to map-and-sum over a list), but it may not infer the original problem's conceptual framing unless there are explicit hints (names, comments, or known formulas) linking the code to that domain."
