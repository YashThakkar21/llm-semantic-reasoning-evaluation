      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number, i.e., a specific subsequence (primes) of the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. The obfuscated code actually computes the nth term of the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence (defined by S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2)), not the nth prime in that sequence. Qwen's description: \"calculates a specific sequence value ... each term is twice the previous term plus the term before that, starting with 1 for the first two terms.\" This matches the recurrence and base cases in the code very well, but it does not mention primes or NSW specifically. Relative to the *ground truth problem*, Qwen has correctly captured the implemented sequence but missed the fact that the intended task is about prime numbers (a filtered subsequence). So semantically, Qwen is accurate about what the code does, but not about what the original problem statement says. Completeness is limited: it gives the recurrence and input/output, but omits any notion of primality or that this is a special named sequence.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: sum of the first k Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The obfuscated new solution defines mX_4q9 as the same sequence generator and then sums mX_4q9(vP_3w) for vP_3w in range(t5_Qm). That is, it sums the first k terms of the NSW sequence, not the first k NSW primes. Qwen's new description: \"calculates the sum of a sequence up to t5_Qm terms, where each term of the sequence is defined as in the raw_solution, and then returns this sum.\" This is an accurate description of the provided code: it correctly identifies that the new function sums the same sequence terms from index 0 to k-1. However, as with the raw problem, it does not mention primes or that the intended objects are NSW primes. So semantically, relative to the code, Qwen is right; relative to the ground truth problem, it misses the prime aspect and the special name. Completeness is moderate: it captures the summation pattern and the dependency on the raw sequence, but not the intended prime-filtering nuance.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the dataset goes from \"nth NSW prime\" to \"sum of first k NSW primes\". The code, however, goes from computing a sequence term to summing the first k terms of that sequence. Qwen correctly recognizes the structural transformation at the code level: the new solution reuses the raw solution as a helper and aggregates its outputs over a range of indices. Its new_problem description explicitly ties the new sequence to \"as in the raw_solution\" and notes that it sums up to t5_Qm terms. This shows good understanding of the relationship between the two code snippets. What Qwen does not capture is that, in the ground truth, both problems are about primes, not just sequence terms. So as an understanding of the *intended* transformation (nth prime → sum of first k primes), it is incomplete, but as an understanding of the *implemented* transformation (nth sequence term → sum of first k sequence terms), it is quite accurate. Hence a relatively high score but not perfect.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (o8_9L, zQ3_x, w_7Yp, k9_Tz, t5_Qm), Qwen correctly inferred the recurrence relation and the iterative DP-like update pattern. It did not rely on names to guess semantics; instead it followed the control flow: base cases for 0 and 1, loop from 2 to n, update using k = 2*prev + prevprev, and then in the new solution, a loop summing calls to the helper function. This indicates strong robustness to naming obfuscation. The main semantic gap is not due to obfuscation but due to the absence of any primality test or filtering logic in the code, so Qwen understandably did not infer \"prime\" or \"Newman–Shanks–Williams prime\" from the implementation alone.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not mention that the intended problems involve Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, not just the raw sequence.",
        "Did not distinguish between computing sequence terms and computing prime elements of that sequence.",
        "Descriptions lack contextual naming or identification of the known sequence, staying generic.",
        "Completeness relative to the ground truth problem statements is limited because prime-related aspects are absent."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid code-level semantic understanding under obfuscation: it correctly reconstructs the recurrence and the summation pattern, and it understands the structural transformation from a single-term computation to an aggregated sum over multiple terms. However, when the ground truth problem includes mathematical context (NSW primes) that is not explicitly manifested in the code (no primality checks or filtering), Qwen naturally stays at the level of what the code actually does and does not infer the higher-level intent. This highlights that Qwen is strong at reasoning from explicit control flow and arithmetic, but will not hallucinate domain-specific labels or prime-related semantics that are not present in the implementation."
