      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description matches the ground truth very closely. Ground truth: \"find the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers.\" Qwen: \"calculates the ratio of zeros to non-zeros in a list of numbers, returning infinity if the list contains only zeros.\" This captures the core semantics (ratio of zeros to non-zeros, input as a list/array of numbers) and even adds the behavior for the all-zero case, which is exactly what the code does. The only minor difference is that the ground truth doesn't explicitly mention the infinity behavior, but the code clearly implements it, so Qwen is correctly describing the implemented semantics. This is fully accurate and complete relative to the code and consistent with the problem intent.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth states: given a list of 2D matrices, compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes for each matrix, then return the average of these ratios; if a matrix contains only zeroes, its ratio is infinity. Qwen's inference: \"computes the average ratio of zeros to non-zeros across multiple matrices, represented as lists of numbers, returning infinity if all matrices contain only zeros.\" Qwen correctly captures that we are now working over multiple matrices and averaging ratios. It also recognizes that the input is a collection of matrices. However, there are two gaps: (1) Qwen's description of the infinity condition is slightly off. The ground truth says each all-zero matrix should have its own ratio as infinity; the code snippet for the new solution only shows averaging precomputed ratios and returning infinity if the list of ratios is empty, not the per-matrix infinity logic. Qwen instead says \"returning infinity if all matrices contain only zeros,\" which conflates a global condition rather than per-matrix behavior. (2) Qwen simplifies the representation of matrices as \"lists of numbers\" rather than explicitly \"2D matrices\" or nested lists, which is a minor loss of detail. Overall, the main semantics (average of zero/non-zero ratios across matrices) are captured, but the handling of the infinity case and matrix structure is less precise.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: extend from a single array to multiple 2D matrices, compute the same ratio per matrix, and then average those ratios, with the per-matrix infinity rule preserved. Qwen's descriptions reflect an understanding that the new problem generalizes the original single-list ratio computation to multiple matrices and then averages the per-matrix ratios. This shows a good grasp of the structural transformation: from one collection to many, and from a single ratio to an average of ratios. However, Qwen's handling of the infinity behavior in the new problem is not fully aligned with the ground truth transformation. It moves from \"list contains only zeros → infinity\" in the raw problem to \"all matrices contain only zeros → infinity\" in the new problem, which is not the same as \"each all-zero matrix has ratio infinity\" plus averaging. So while Qwen understands the high-level evolution (single ratio → average over many), it misses the nuanced per-matrix infinity rule and instead describes a global condition. Hence, good but not perfect understanding of the transformation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The provided obfuscated snippets are quite minimal, but they do use non-semantic names (e.g., `z3r0_c0unt`, `m4tr1x`, `m4tr1c3s`, `r4t10s`). Qwen clearly did not rely on these names to infer behavior; instead, it followed the control flow and operations: comprehending that `z3r0_c0unt(m4tr1x)` is producing some per-matrix metric, that these are collected into `r4t10s`, and that the final result is `sum(r4t10s) / len(r4t10s)` (an average). Similarly, in the raw solution, it correctly interprets `all(x == 0 for x in nums)` and the ratio of `sum(x == 0)` to `sum(x != 0)`. Its descriptions are consistent with the actual operations rather than the misleading names, indicating strong robustness to obfuscation. The only inaccuracies stem from higher-level interpretation of edge cases (infinity condition), not from being misled by variable naming.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "For the new problem, the description of the infinity condition is not fully aligned with the ground truth per-matrix rule, instead suggesting a global condition (all matrices contain only zeros).",
        "Did not explicitly emphasize that matrices are 2D structures (e.g., nested lists) and simplified them to \"lists of numbers,\" losing a small but relevant detail.",
        "Transformation explanation implicitly misses that the per-matrix infinity behavior should be preserved and then averaged, rather than collapsed into a single global infinity condition."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows a strong ability to infer semantics from code even when names are obfuscated, focusing on operations like comprehensions, conditionals, and arithmetic to reconstruct the problem description. It accurately generalizes from a single-collection ratio computation to an average over multiple collections, reflecting good understanding of structural transformations. The main area where it falls short is in capturing nuanced edge-case semantics (how and when infinity should be produced) in the generalized setting. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation and strong on core algorithmic understanding, careful attention to edge-case propagation in problem transformations remains a subtle challenge."
