      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: function takes two tuples and performs element-wise division, returning a tuple of results.\nQwen raw: \"calculates the element-wise division of two lists, `r9t_8y` and `k4m_3p`, and returns the results as a tuple.\"\n\nWhat it got right:\n- Correctly identified element-wise division.\n- Correctly captured that there are two sequence-like inputs.\n- Correctly captured that the result is a tuple.\n\nWhat it missed / minor inaccuracies:\n- Described the inputs as lists rather than tuples. The code itself uses `zip` and `tuple(...)`, so the return type is clearly a tuple, but the input type is not enforced by the snippet; the ground truth specifies tuples. Qwen generalized to lists, which is semantically close but not type-accurate relative to the problem statement.\n- Did not explicitly state that the function is intended to take tuples, as per the ground truth description.\n\nOverall, Qwen understood the core semantics (element-wise division of two sequences, returning a tuple) but was slightly off on the specified input type and did not mention that the operation is across corresponding elements of tuples as a problem statement requirement.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: function takes a list of tuples; for each tuple, performs element-wise division and returns a list of tuples with the division results for each input tuple.\nQwen new: \"applies a function `h5j_9n` to each pair of elements from the list `l6q_4r`, which is expected to contain tuples or lists of two elements, and returns the results as a list.\"\n\nWhat it got right:\n- Recognized that the outer structure is a list (`l6q_4r`) and that the function returns a list.\n- Correctly identified that each element of the list is unpacked into two items (`w8x_2, v3b_7`) and passed to `h5j_9n`.\n- Correctly described the high-level pattern: map a binary function over a list of 2-element items.\n\nWhat it missed / inaccuracies:\n- Did not mention that `h5j_9n` itself is the element-wise division function from the raw problem; it only calls it a function, losing the division semantics that are central in the ground truth.\n- Ground truth specifies \"list of tuples\"; Qwen weakens this to \"tuples or lists of two elements\". That’s reasonable from the code alone, but it diverges from the dataset’s stricter specification.\n- Ground truth emphasizes that the output is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the division results for the corresponding input tuple. Qwen only says \"returns the results as a list\" without specifying that each result is a tuple of division results, so the structure and operation semantics are under-specified.\n\nThus, Qwen captured the mapping structure but not the specific mathematical operation or the precise input/output tuple structure required by the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "Ground truth transformation: The raw problem is element-wise division of two tuples. The new problem generalizes this to a higher-order/mapped version: given a list of such tuples, apply the same element-wise division to each tuple and return a list of result tuples.\n\nQwen’s view:\n- Raw: element-wise division of two sequences, returning a tuple.\n- New: apply a function `h5j_9n` to each pair of elements from a list of 2-element items, returning a list.\n\nWhat Qwen understood:\n- It recognized that the new solution is a mapping of a binary function over a list of pairs, which is structurally the right transformation: from a single pair operation to a list-of-pairs operation.\n- It correctly identified the change in outer container: from a single call to returning a list of results.\n\nWhat is missing:\n- It did not explicitly connect that `h5j_9n` is the same element-wise division operation defined in the raw problem. So the conceptual evolution \"take the previous division function and apply it across a list of inputs\" is not clearly articulated.\n- It did not mention that each result should be a tuple of division results, preserving the tuple structure per input tuple.\n\nOverall, Qwen captured the structural transformation (single operation → list of operations via mapping) but did not fully articulate the semantic continuity of the division operation and tuple structure across the transformation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`r9t_8y`, `k4m_3p`, `h5j_9n`, `l6q_4r`), Qwen relied on the code structure:\n- For the raw solution, it correctly interpreted `tuple(x7z_ / q2w_ for x7z_, q2w_ in zip(...))` as element-wise division and recognized the tuple return type.\n- For the new solution, it correctly interpreted the list comprehension `[h5j_9n(w8x_2, v3b_7) for w8x_2, v3b_7 in l6q_4r]` as applying a binary function to each 2-element item in a list.\n\nThe main weaknesses are not due to obfuscation but due to not inferring or stating the specific semantics of `h5j_9n` in the new problem and not aligning precisely with the dataset’s type constraints (tuples vs generic sequences). The obfuscation did not prevent Qwen from understanding the control/data flow; it mainly affected how specifically it described the function’s purpose in the new problem.",

        "Described inputs as lists instead of tuples in the raw problem, diverging from the ground truth specification.",

        "Did not clearly specify that the new problem returns a list of tuples containing division results for each input tuple.",
        "Only partially articulated the relationship between the raw and new problems (same operation generalized over a list)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid structural understanding of the code even under obfuscation: it correctly infers element-wise operations, container types for outputs, and the mapping pattern from a single operation to a list of operations. However, it tends to under-specify or generalize away key semantic details, especially in the new problem: it treats `h5j_9n` as an opaque function rather than recognizing or stating that it is the division function from the raw problem. This indicates that while Qwen can follow control flow and data flow reliably, it may not always propagate or restate the precise semantics of helper functions when describing higher-level transformations, leading to incomplete problem descriptions relative to the dataset’s ground truth."
