      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the last digit of a given number. Code: take absolute value if negative, then `% 10`. Qwen's description: \"calculates the last digit of the absolute value of a variable named 'a7x_9'.\" This is semantically correct and even slightly more precise than the ground truth by explicitly mentioning the absolute value step. It correctly captures the purpose (last digit), the input (a number), and the operation (mod 10). No important aspect is missing.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: \"find the last digit of the sum of the last digits of a list of numbers.\" Code: `return sum(z8q_2r(b4m_1k) for b4m_1k in w3p_5s) % 10`. Given that `z8q_2r` is the previous function (last digit of a number), this matches: apply last-digit function to each element, sum those last digits, then take `% 10`. Qwen's description: \"computes the sum of the results from applying a function 'z8q_2r' to each element in an iterable 'w3p_5s', and then returns the last digit of this sum.\" This is exactly what the code does and matches the intended semantics. The only minor gap is that Qwen doesn't explicitly say that `z8q_2r` itself computes last digits, so it doesn't fully verbalize \"sum of the last digits of a list of numbers\" in one sentence, but it is implicitly correct given the raw problem. Hence high semantic accuracy, with a slight deduction on completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: go from computing the last digit of a single number to computing the last digit of the sum of last digits over a collection. Qwen's raw description identifies the base operation (last digit of absolute value). Its new description correctly describes mapping that function over an iterable, summing, and taking the last digit of the sum. This shows it understood that the new problem builds directly on the old one by lifting the single-number operation to a list/iterable and then aggregating. That matches the ground truth transformation very well.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`a7x_9`, `z8q_2r`, `w3p_5s`), Qwen relied on the control flow and arithmetic operations rather than names. For the raw code, it inferred the absolute value and modulo behavior correctly. For the new code, it recognized the generator expression, the use of `sum`, and the final `% 10`, and described them in generic but accurate terms (\"iterable\", \"applying a function\"). It did not attempt to guess misleading semantics from the names, which indicates strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified that the raw function computes the last digit (via absolute value and modulo).",
        "Correctly described the higher-order pattern in the new code: apply a function to each element, sum results, then take last digit.",
        "Captured the relationship between the two problems: the new one composes and aggregates the original operation.",
        "Did not rely on variable or function names; focused on structural semantics (abs-like behavior and `% 10`, generator + sum)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "In the new problem description, Qwen did not explicitly restate that `z8q_2r` is the last-digit function, so it stopped one step short of phrasing the task as \"sum of last digits of a list of numbers.\"",
        "The description is slightly more code-centric (\"results from applying a function\") than problem-centric (\"last digits of numbers in a list\"), which affects completeness relative to the natural-language ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of simple arithmetic and aggregation patterns even under heavy name obfuscation. It correctly tracks how a base operation (last digit of a number) is reused and lifted to operate over collections. The minor gaps are in natural-language abstraction (not explicitly naming `z8q_2r` as a last-digit function in the new description), not in code comprehension. This suggests that for straightforward numeric logic, Qwen is highly robust to poor naming and can accurately infer both the core behavior and its composition across functions."
