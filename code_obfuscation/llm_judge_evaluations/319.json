      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is: find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The obfuscated raw solution snippet is the core formula: a7z_9q = math.sqrt(2 * math.pow(10,(b2x_4m - 1))); return round(a7z_9q). This is indeed the mathematical expression for the index k of the smallest triangular number with a given number of digits n (b2x_4m). Qwen's description: \"The code calculates the square root of twice ten raised to the power of (b2x_4m - 1), rounds the result, and returns it.\" This is an accurate literal description of what the code does computationally, but it does not connect this to triangular numbers or to the notion of an index or digit count. Semantically, at the code level, Qwen correctly captured the operation (sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1)) and rounding). At the problem level, it missed the higher-level meaning (triangular numbers and digit length). Hence, semantic accuracy is middling: correct low-level math, missing the semantic intent. Completeness is low because it omits any mention of triangular numbers, indices, or digits as such.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: given a list of n values, compute the sum of the indices of the smallest triangular numbers with n digits for each n in the list. The obfuscated new solution is: return sum(w8k_3r(p5t_1n) for p5t_1n in q9m_7s). Here w8k_3r is clearly the helper that computes the index for a single n (the raw solution), and q9m_7s is the iterable of n values. Qwen's inferred description: \"The code computes the sum of applying the function w8k_3r to each element in the iterable q9m_7s and returns the total sum.\" This is a precise description of the code's behavior at the structural level: mapping a function over an iterable and summing the results. However, it again fails to connect w8k_3r to \"index of smallest triangular number with n digits\" and q9m_7s to \"list of digit counts\". So semantically, it understands the control structure and aggregation but not the problem domain. Completeness is low because it misses the key domain semantics (triangular numbers, digits, indices) and the fact that the list elements are n-digit specifications.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a single-input function (index for one n) to a list-based function that sums the indices for multiple n values. Qwen's raw description focuses on the numeric formula; its new description focuses on summing the results of applying that formula-like function to each element of an iterable. It does recognize that the new code is a higher-order application of the original function over a collection and that the outputs are summed. However, it does not articulate that this is specifically about triangular numbers or about digit counts, nor does it explicitly relate the new problem to the original problem statement (\"smallest triangular number with n digits\" → \"sum of such indices for a list of n\"). Thus, it partially grasps the structural transformation (single call → map + sum over list) but misses the semantic transformation in terms of the problem domain. This warrants a low-to-mid score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (b2x_4m, w8k_3r, q9m_7s), Qwen correctly inferred the low-level semantics from the code structure and math operations. For the raw snippet, it accurately described sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1)) and rounding, showing it relied on the math operations rather than variable names. For the new snippet, it correctly recognized a generator expression applying a function to each element of an iterable and summing the results, again independent of naming. The main failure is not due to obfuscation but due to not connecting the mathematical formula and helper function to the higher-level concept of triangular numbers and digit counts. So robustness to obfuscation is relatively strong: Qwen handled the obfuscation well at the code-structure level but did not infer the original problem context, which is not directly evident from the tiny snippets alone.",

        "Accurately described the mathematical computation sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1)) and the rounding operation in the raw solution.",

        "Did not rely on variable names; instead, it used the actual operations and Python constructs to infer behavior.",

        "Failed to connect the mathematical formula to the concept of triangular numbers and their indices.",
        "Did not mention that the parameter represents the number of digits, nor that the result is an index of a triangular number.",
        "For the new problem, did not explain that the list elements are digit counts and that the sum is over indices of smallest triangular numbers with those digit counts.",
        "Did not explicitly relate the new problem description back to the raw problem's semantics; only described structural mapping and summation.",
        "Overall, captured implementation-level behavior but missed the domain-level problem semantics."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid understanding of low-level code semantics and control structures even under obfuscation: it can correctly describe mathematical expressions and higher-order patterns like generator expressions and sum. However, it struggles to infer the original problem domain (triangular numbers and digit counts) from a minimal code snippet that only shows the final formula and a simple aggregation. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscated naming and can accurately parse and describe what the code does step by step, it may not reconstruct the higher-level problem statement unless there are more explicit semantic cues in the code (comments, variable names, or more context). The evaluation highlights a gap between syntactic/operational understanding and full semantic/problem-domain reconstruction."
