      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the number of divisors of a given integer. Qwen: \"The code calculates the number of divisors of a given integer q8_w.\" This is perfectly aligned: it identifies the input (a single integer) and the operation (counting its divisors). No semantic detail is missing or wrong for the raw problem. Hence both semantic accuracy and completeness are maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: for a list of integers, compute the number of divisors for each integer and return the sum of these counts. Code: sum(b3_xk9(z7_m) for z7_m in p2_l8r) where b3_xk9 is the divisor-counting function. Qwen: \"The code computes the sum of the results of applying function b3_xk9 to each element in list p2_l8r.\" Semantically, this is correct at the code level: it recognizes a map-then-sum pattern over a list. However, it does not explicitly connect b3_xk9 back to \"number of divisors\" in this new description, nor does it restate that the list elements are integers and that the sum is of divisor counts. So semantic accuracy is high (the described behavior matches the code) but not fully grounded in the original problem semantics, and completeness is lower because it omits the key interpretation that b3_xk9 is the divisor-count function and that the list is of integers.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend the single-integer divisor-count function to a list of integers and aggregate the counts by summing. Qwen's new description correctly captures that the new solution applies the original function (b3_xk9) to each element of a list and sums the results, which reflects the structural transformation from scalar to list + aggregation. What it does not explicitly articulate is that this means \"number of divisors for each integer, then sum those counts\"—it stays at the level of \"results of applying b3_xk9\". Still, the relationship between raw and new (reuse of the original function over a collection and summation) is clearly understood, so the transformation understanding is strong but not perfect.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated names (q8_w, a9z_2x, b3_xk9, p2_l8r, z7_m) do not seem to hinder Qwen. For the raw problem, it correctly infers that the comprehension with `range(1, q8_w + 1)` and `q8_w % a9z_2x == 0` is counting divisors. For the new problem, it recognizes the higher-order pattern `sum(f(x) for x in list)` despite meaningless identifiers. This indicates that Qwen is relying on structural and operational semantics rather than variable names. The only minor gap is that in the new problem description it does not restate the semantic meaning of b3_xk9, but that is more about description completeness than misunderstanding due to obfuscation.",

        "Did not explicitly mention that the list elements are integers and that the sum is of divisor counts, reducing completeness relative to the ground truth problem statement."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of the obfuscated code, especially for the core divisor-counting logic. It also correctly grasps the structural transformation from a single-input function to a list-processing aggregator. The main limitation is that its higher-level natural language description for the new problem remains somewhat code-centric (\"results of applying b3_xk9\") instead of fully mapping back to the original mathematical semantics (\"number of divisors for each integer\"). This suggests that while Qwen can follow and reuse function behavior across transformations, it may sometimes omit re-articulating known semantics when describing composed operations."
