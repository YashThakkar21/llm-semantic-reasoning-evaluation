      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is about removing the k-th element from a list. The obfuscated raw solution `return a7b_2x[:q9z-1] + a7b_2x[q9z:]` is structurally a sequence-slicing operation that removes the element at position `q9z-1` (0-based index) from `a7b_2x`. Qwen describes this as: \"The code removes the character at index q9z-1 from the string a7b_2x.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly identifies that the operation removes the element at index `q9z-1` from a sequence, but it incorrectly narrows the type to a string and calls the element a \"character\" rather than treating it generically as a list element. It also does not mention that the function is supposed to work on lists, nor that the output is a new list with the same elements except the removed one. So the core operation (removing an element at a given index via slicing and concatenation) is understood, but the problem context (list vs string, generality) is not. Hence low but non-zero scores for semantic accuracy and completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem generalizes from removing a single k-th element to removing multiple elements at specified indices from a list, preserving order. The obfuscated new solution:\n```python\nm3_xqp = sorted(m3_xqp, reverse=True)\nfor w8k_r in m3_xqp:\n    a7b_2x = f5j_9tz(a7b_2x, w8k_r)\nreturn a7b_2x\n```\nimplements this by sorting the indices in descending order and repeatedly applying a helper that removes an element at a given index, so that earlier removals do not shift the positions of later ones. Qwen's description: \"The code sorts the list m3_xqp in descending order and then iteratively applies the function f5j_9tz to the variable a7b_2x using each element of m3_xqp, returning the modified a7b_2x.\" This is a literal description of the control flow and data flow but misses the semantic intent: that `m3_xqp` is a list of indices, `f5j_9tz` removes an element at a given index, and the overall effect is to remove multiple elements from a list while preserving the order of the remaining elements. Qwen does correctly capture the sorting in descending order and iterative application, but does not connect that to index-based deletion or to the higher-level problem statement. Thus semantic accuracy is partial (it gets the structural behavior but not the purpose), and completeness is low because it omits the key aspects: indices, removal, and order preservation.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from removing a single k-th element from a list to removing multiple elements at specified indices, implemented by sorting indices in reverse and repeatedly applying the single-removal function. Qwen's raw description focuses on removing a character from a string; its new description focuses on sorting a list and applying a function repeatedly. It does not articulate that the new code is a generalization of the raw behavior to multiple indices, nor that `f5j_9tz` is essentially the raw single-removal operation. While Qwen implicitly recognizes that the new code repeatedly applies some transformation to `a7b_2x` based on `m3_xqp`, it does not connect this to the semantics of element removal or to the evolution of the problem from single to multiple deletions. Therefore, understanding of the raw→new transformation is weak, though not entirely absent because it at least notes the iterative application over a sorted list.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names, the core operations are simple: slicing and concatenation in the raw solution, and sorting plus a loop in the new solution. Qwen correctly identifies the structural behavior: in the raw case, it recognizes that the code removes the element at `q9z-1` from the sequence; in the new case, it recognizes sorting `m3_xqp` in descending order and iteratively applying `f5j_9tz`. However, Qwen appears to rely heavily on surface-level patterns and does not infer the higher-level semantics (list element removal, indices, order preservation) from the structure. It also incorrectly assumes `a7b_2x` is a string in the raw case, suggesting it did not generalize from the generic sequence operation to the list-focused problem description. Overall, Qwen shows some robustness in parsing control flow and basic operations under obfuscation, but limited robustness in inferring the intended problem semantics beyond the literal code behavior.",

        "Correctly identified that the raw code removes the element at position q9z-1 from a sequence via slicing and concatenation.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Misclassified the sequence in the raw problem as a string and the removed element as a character, missing that the intended domain is a list of elements.",
        "Failed to state that the purpose is to remove the k-th element from a list and return a new list with that element removed.",
        "In the new problem, did not infer that m3_xqp is a list of indices and that f5j_9tz removes elements at those indices.",
        "Did not mention that the overall effect of the new code is to remove multiple elements at specified indices while preserving the order of the remaining elements.",
        "Did not connect the new solution back to the raw solution as a generalization from single-element removal to multiple-element removal."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen can reliably describe low-level structural behavior (slicing, sorting, looping, repeated function application) even with obfuscated identifiers, but it struggles to lift that understanding to the higher-level problem semantics when the code is short and the intent must be inferred. It tends to give a literal description of what the code does step-by-step rather than interpreting the role of variables (e.g., indices vs generic numbers) and the overall purpose (removing elements from a list). This leads to partial semantic accuracy: the mechanics are right, but the problem-level description (list element removal, indices, order preservation, and the generalization from single to multiple deletions) is largely missing. The obfuscation mainly exposes that Qwen does not strongly infer types and roles from usage patterns (e.g., that a sliceable sequence in this context is likely a list, or that a sorted list used as loop indices is a list of positions to delete)."
