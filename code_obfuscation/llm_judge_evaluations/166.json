      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's description for the raw problem — \"The code calculates the nth Lucas number using a recursive approach\" — matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is \"Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.\" Qwen correctly identifies: (1) the sequence is Lucas numbers, (2) the function returns the nth term, and (3) the implementation is recursive. There is no misunderstanding or missing core detail here.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: \"Write a function to find the sum of the first 'k' Lucas numbers starting from the 'start' position.\" Qwen's inference: \"The code computes the sum of Lucas numbers from index 'start' to 'start + k - 1'.\" This is fully equivalent: summing k Lucas numbers starting at index 'start' is exactly summing from 'start' to 'start + k - 1'. Qwen also implicitly captures that these are Lucas numbers by referencing the Lucas-computing function. The example in the ground truth (start=3, k=2) is not repeated, but the general rule Qwen states already covers that example, so no important detail is lost.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from computing a single nth Lucas number to computing the sum of a contiguous block of k Lucas numbers starting at a given index. Qwen's raw description correctly identifies the base operation (nth Lucas via recursion). Its new description correctly identifies that the new function iterates from 'start' to 'start + k - 1' and sums the Lucas values. This shows a correct understanding that the new problem builds directly on the raw one by aggregating multiple Lucas values rather than changing the underlying sequence or logic. Thus, Qwen clearly grasps the relationship between the two problems.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names like 'a8_xyz' and 'q2_w', Qwen correctly infers the semantics from the control structure: a loop over range(start, start + k) accumulating find_lucas(q2_w). It does not rely on names to guess meaning; instead it uses the loop bounds and the call to the Lucas function to infer that this is a sum over a contiguous index range. Similarly, in the raw solution, it correctly recognizes the Lucas recurrence from the base cases (2, 1) and the recursive relation, rather than misidentifying it as Fibonacci. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the Lucas sequence and did not confuse it with Fibonacci despite similar recurrence structure.",
        "Correctly captured that the raw function returns the nth Lucas number using recursion.",
        "Accurately described the new function as summing Lucas numbers over the index range [start, start + k - 1].",
        "Understood the relationship between the raw and new problems: the new builds on the raw by summing multiple terms.",
        "Did not depend on variable names; instead relied on control flow and function calls to infer semantics."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not restate the illustrative example (start=3, k=2) from the ground truth, though the general description already implies it.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that the summation is over exactly 'k' terms, though this is implied by 'start to start + k - 1'."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can robustly interpret mathematical sequence code even when variable names are meaningless. It correctly distinguished Lucas from Fibonacci by using the base cases, and it correctly interpreted the range-based loop to describe the sum over a contiguous block of indices. The inferred problem statements are not only semantically accurate but also structurally aligned with the ground truth, indicating that Qwen is reasoning from the code's logic rather than relying on naming or superficial patterns."
