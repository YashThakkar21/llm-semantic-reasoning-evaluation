      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the directrix of a parabola. For a parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c, the directrix is y = (4ac - b^2 - 1) / (4a), or some equivalent formula depending on the exact definition used in the dataset. The obfuscated raw solution returns `int(c - ((b * b) + 1) * 4 * a)`, which is some algebraic expression related to a, b, c and the constant 1. Qwen's description: \"calculates and returns the result of a quadratic equation's discriminant formula, specifically (c - ((b * b) + 1) * 4 * a).\" This is incorrect semantically: it is not the discriminant (which would be b^2 - 4ac), and Qwen does not connect the expression to the geometric notion of a parabola's directrix at all. It only restates the arithmetic expression and mislabels it as a discriminant. Thus, it fails to capture the intended semantic purpose (directrix) and misidentifies the mathematical concept. Completeness is also minimal: no mention of parabolas, directrix, or how this value is used.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of parabolas represented by (a, b, c), compute the sum of the directrices of all parabolas, return 0 if the list is empty. The obfuscated new solution: it initializes an accumulator, iterates over a list of tuples, unpacks each into three values, applies `w1n_5` to them, and sums the results. Given the ground truth, `w1n_5` is presumably the directrix-computing function from the raw problem. Qwen's new description: \"iterates over a list of tuples, applies a function w1n_5 to each tuple, sums up the results, and returns the total sum.\" This is structurally accurate about the code but misses the semantic meaning: that the tuples are (a, b, c) coefficients of parabolas and that `w1n_5` computes a directrix. It also omits the explicit behavior for an empty list (return 0), though that is implicitly true from summing starting at 0. So semantically, Qwen captures the iteration and summation pattern but not the domain-specific meaning (parabolas, directrices). Completeness is partial: control flow and aggregation are described, but the key problem context and data interpretation are missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is: from computing the directrix of a single parabola (given a, b, c) to computing the sum of directrices over a list of such parabolas. Qwen's raw description misidentifies the core operation as a discriminant-like arithmetic expression, not a directrix. In the new description, Qwen correctly recognizes that the new code applies the earlier function to each tuple and sums the results. However, it does not connect that this is a lifting of the single-parabola operation to a list of parabolas, nor that the tuples represent coefficients and the function computes a directrix. Thus, Qwen partially understands the structural transformation (\"map then sum\" over a list using the previous function) but misses the semantic transformation in terms of the problem domain. Hence a low-to-moderate score: it gets the higher-order pattern but not the meaning.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The variable names are obfuscated (`g7_x`, `z3q`, `l9m_w`, `w1n_5`), but the control structure is straightforward. Qwen correctly infers that the new solution iterates over a list of tuples, unpacks them, applies a function, and sums the results. This shows it is using code structure rather than names. However, for the raw solution, Qwen both mislabels the expression as a discriminant and fails to infer its intended geometric meaning (directrix). That failure is less about obfuscation and more about the code being a bare arithmetic expression with no contextual clues. Qwen does handle the obfuscated names reasonably in the new solution (identifying tuples and accumulation) but does not go beyond syntactic behavior to domain semantics. Overall robustness is moderate: it is not misled by bad names in terms of control flow, but it does not recover the higher-level mathematical intent.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Misidentified the raw expression as a discriminant-related formula, which is mathematically incorrect and unrelated to the intended directrix computation.",
        "Failed to mention parabolas, coefficients (a, b, c), or directrices in either the raw or new problem descriptions.",
        "Did not capture the domain-level transformation from a single-parabola directrix computation to summing directrices over a list of parabolas.",
        "Omitted the explicit problem-level detail that an empty list should yield 0, even though this is implied by the code."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen appears to be good at extracting structural behavior from obfuscated code—identifying loops, tuple unpacking, function application, and aggregation—without relying on meaningful variable names. However, when the code is a bare arithmetic expression with no comments or naming hints, Qwen tends to assign a generic or incorrect mathematical label (e.g., calling it a discriminant) rather than inferring the intended geometric concept (directrix). This highlights a gap between syntactic understanding and domain-level semantic understanding: Qwen can describe what the code does procedurally but struggles to map that behavior to the original problem statement when the mapping is not explicitly signaled in the code."
