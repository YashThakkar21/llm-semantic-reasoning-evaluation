      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the volume of a triangular prism = (base * height / 2) * length. The obfuscated code `return ((l8_3x * b_9z2 * h4_w_) / 2)` clearly matches that formula: l8_3x is the prism length, b_9z2 is the triangle base, h4_w_ is the triangle height. Qwen's description says it \"calculates the area of a triangle\" and treats the length as an \"extra dimension\" not typically used in triangle area. This misidentifies the quantity: it's volume, not area. Qwen does recognize the three parameters and notes the extra dimension, but fails to connect it to a prism. So the semantic core (volume vs area) is wrong, and the description is incomplete because it doesn't state that the function returns a prism volume.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of tuples (length, base, height), compute the total volume of multiple triangular prisms by summing individual volumes. The obfuscated code initializes `t0t4l_9x = 0`, iterates over `pr1sm_8z` in `pr1sms_7w`, and accumulates `f1nd_V0lum3_2x(*pr1sm_8z)`. Qwen's description: \"calculates the total volume of multiple prisms by summing up the volumes of each prism\" with volumes computed by `f1nd_V0lum3_2x` from the list `pr1sms_7w`. This matches the semantics and captures the key aspects: multiple prisms, list of dimensions, summation of volumes via the helper function. It doesn't explicitly restate that these are triangular prisms or that tuples are (length, base, height), but given only the shown snippet, its description is fully aligned with the ground truth intent.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: single-prism volume → aggregate total volume over multiple prisms using the same volume function. Qwen's raw understanding mislabels the base function as triangle area with an extra dimension, but in the new problem it correctly interprets the higher-level operation as summing volumes of multiple prisms using that function. So it does understand the structural transformation: reuse of the base computation over a list and accumulation. It partially misses the conceptual continuity (triangular prism volume specifically), but it correctly grasps that the new function is an aggregation wrapper around the original. Hence a strong but not perfect score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names, Qwen correctly inferred in the new problem that the code is summing volumes of prisms from a list using a helper function. It relied on structural cues: iteration over a list, accumulation into `t0t4l_9x`, and calling a function that clearly suggests volume (`f1nd_V0lum3_2x`). However, in the raw problem it failed to interpret the three-parameter product divided by 2 as a triangular prism volume and instead called it a triangle area with an extra dimension. This shows that Qwen could follow control flow and aggregation under obfuscation, but struggled slightly with recognizing the geometric formula from the bare expression.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified that the new solution computes the total volume over multiple prisms by summing individual volumes.",
        "Recognized the role of the helper function `f1nd_V0lum3_2x` as the per-prism volume calculator in the new problem.",
        "Handled the loop and accumulation pattern well despite obfuscated variable names.",
        "Captured the list-of-dimensions input and summation output behavior for the new problem."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Misinterpreted the core quantity in the raw problem as triangle area instead of triangular prism volume.",
        "Did not connect the third parameter (length) to the notion of a prism in the raw problem.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that the prisms are triangular in the new problem, nor the exact tuple structure (length, base, height).",
        "Conceptual inconsistency: the helper is described as computing triangle area in the raw description but used as a volume function in the new description without reconciling this."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong understanding of control-flow and aggregation patterns under obfuscation: it correctly infers that the new function iterates over a list of prism specifications and sums volumes. However, it is less reliable at inferring the exact physical or geometric semantics from a bare arithmetic expression with three factors and a division by 2; it defaulted to a simpler 'triangle area' interpretation and treated the length as extraneous. This suggests that while Qwen can robustly track how functions are composed and reused, its recognition of domain-specific formulas (like triangular prism volume) may be brittle when variable names are unhelpful. The discrepancy between raw and new descriptions also indicates that higher-level structural cues (loops, accumulation, function naming) can override earlier misinterpretations, leading to more accurate descriptions at the composite level than at the primitive level."
