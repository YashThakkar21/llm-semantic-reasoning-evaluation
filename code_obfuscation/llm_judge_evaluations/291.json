      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: find even numbers from a list. Code: `[a7x_9q for a7x_9q in z3_m8k if a7x_9q % 2 == 0]`. Qwen's description: \"filters and returns a list of even numbers from the input list z3_m8k.\" This is exactly what the code does and matches the ground truth problem: it identifies and returns the even numbers from a single list. It correctly captures input (a list), operation (filter by evenness), and output (list of even numbers). No important detail is missing or incorrect.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: \"find the sum of even numbers in multiple lists of numbers.\" The obfuscated code: `return sum(b2_v5n for z3_m8k in f9_x1p for b2_v5n in q8_t4r(z3_m8k))`. Interpreting both solutions together, q8_t4r is the earlier function that returns even numbers from a list; f9_x1p is a collection of lists; the generator flattens the even numbers from each sublist and sums them. Qwen's description: \"calculates the sum of elements obtained by applying the function q8_t4r to each element in the sublists of f9_x1p.\" This is partially right: it recognizes a sum over results of q8_t4r, but it phrases it as applying q8_t4r to \"each element in the sublists\" rather than to each sublist itself, and it never states that the elements being summed are specifically even numbers. It also doesn't explicitly say that f9_x1p is a collection of lists. So semantically it's in the right direction (sum over outputs of q8_t4r), but it misses the key semantic of \"sum of even numbers across multiple lists\" and is a bit vague/misleading about the level at which q8_t4r is applied.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about extracting even numbers from a single list; the new problem is about summing even numbers across multiple lists. The code transformation reflects this: first a filter, then a nested comprehension plus sum over multiple sublists using that filter. Qwen implicitly recognizes that the new code is aggregating via `sum` over results of q8_t4r, which is the function from the raw problem. However, it does not clearly articulate that the transformation is from \"return list of evens\" to \"sum all evens from multiple lists\". Its wording suggests a generic \"sum of elements obtained by applying q8_t4r\" without tying that back to the specific semantic of even numbers or the multi-list aspect. Thus it partially understands the structural transformation (composition and aggregation) but not the full problem-level evolution.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "For the raw solution, Qwen completely ignored the obfuscated names and relied on the arithmetic and list comprehension structure to infer that the function filters even numbers. This shows strong robustness to obfuscation there. For the new solution, it correctly recognized the use of `sum` over a nested generator and the role of q8_t4r, again not relying on variable names. However, it did not fully infer that q8_t4r is specifically an \"even-number filter\" and that the outer structure represents multiple lists; it stayed at a more syntactic description. So Qwen handled obfuscation well at the code-structure level, but its semantic linkage between the two functions (\"q8_t4r returns even numbers, therefore the sum is of even numbers across all sublists\") was incomplete.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly state that the new function sums even numbers, missing the key semantic link to q8_t4r’s behavior.",
        "Misphrased the application of q8_t4r as being to \"each element in the sublists\" rather than to each sublist, which is structurally inaccurate.",
        "Did not clearly express that f9_x1p is a collection of lists (multiple lists) and that the operation spans all of them.",
        "Only partially captured the transformation from a single-list filter to a multi-list sum of evens."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong local semantic understanding of simple list comprehensions and arithmetic conditions, as seen in the raw problem where it precisely captured the even-number filtering despite obfuscated names. In the composed case, it recognizes higher-order structure (sum over generator, reuse of a helper function) but tends to describe behavior in a generic way rather than fully propagating the known semantics of the helper function (that it filters evens). This suggests that while Qwen can parse and describe code structure under obfuscation, it may not always integrate the semantics of previously inferred components when reasoning about composed functions, leading to partial or underspecified problem descriptions."
