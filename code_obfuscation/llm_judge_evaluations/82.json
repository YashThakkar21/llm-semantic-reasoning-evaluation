      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description, \"Calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius,\" matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The function indeed takes a radius and returns 2 * math.pi * r, which is the standard circumference formula. It correctly identifies the input (radius) and output (circumference) and the core purpose (circumference of a circle). No important detail is missing for such a simple problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen states: \"Calculates the total circumference of multiple circles given their radii in a list.\" This aligns perfectly with the ground truth: summing circumferences over a list of radii. The code iterates over t1_e8_Q, uses circle_circumference(r7_) (the same base function) and accumulates the sum. Qwen captures that the input is a list of radii and the output is the total circumference. All key aspects (multiple circles, list input, total/combined circumference) are present.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is from a single-circle circumference calculation to aggregating that calculation over multiple circles. Qwen's descriptions reflect this evolution precisely: the raw problem is about one circle; the new problem is about multiple circles and their total circumference. This shows it understood that the new solution builds on the original function and generalizes it to a list, preserving the same core operation but changing the input structure and output meaning (sum vs single value).",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like x9Z_a4b, t1_e8_Q, q2_W, and r7_, Qwen correctly inferred that the loop iterates over radii and accumulates the sum of circumferences. It did not rely on variable names but instead on the structure: initialization of an accumulator, a for-loop over a collection, calling circle_circumference on each element, and returning the accumulated value. This indicates strong robustness to naming obfuscation for this snippet.",

        "Perfect semantic match for the raw single-circle circumference function.",
        "Accurate identification of list input and total/combined result in the new problem.",

      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can fully recover the intended problem descriptions from minimal and obfuscated code when the logic is straightforward. It correctly abstracts from implementation details (loop, accumulator) to a high-level description (total circumference of multiple circles) and maintains a consistent understanding of how the new problem generalizes the original one. The performance here suggests strong reliance on code structure and mathematical operations rather than on identifier names."
