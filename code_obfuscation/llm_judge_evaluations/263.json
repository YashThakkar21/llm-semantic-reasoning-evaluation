      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: remove leading zeroes from each octet of an IP address. Actual code: `re.sub('\\.[0]*', '.', ip)` which (even if slightly buggy) is clearly targeting zeros immediately after a dot, i.e., leading zeros in octets. Qwen's description: \"removes trailing zeros after a decimal point in an IP address string.\" This reverses the direction: it says trailing zeros instead of leading zeros. That is a semantic error about what part of the number is being normalized. It also misses that this is specifically about IP addresses and their octets, not generic decimal formatting. So the core purpose (normalize IP by removing leading zeros in octets) is misunderstood, and important detail (leading vs trailing) is wrong. Hence very low semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of IP addresses, remove leading zeros from each IP address and then sort the list in ascending order. The obfuscated code: `removezero_ip` is applied to each element in the list, then `sorted` is called. Qwen's description: \"removes trailing zeros after a decimal point from each element in a list of strings and returns the sorted list.\" Again, it misidentifies the operation as removing trailing zeros instead of leading zeros after a dot. It also generalizes to \"list of strings\" rather than IP addresses, losing the domain-specific context. While Qwen correctly notes that the function processes each element of a list and returns a sorted list, it misstates the core transformation being applied to each element. Thus semantic accuracy is very low, and completeness is also low because the IP-specific nature and the leading-zero normalization are not captured.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is: extend the single-string IP normalization to a list of IPs and add sorting. Qwen's inferred transformation mirrors this pattern structurally: from a single string operation to applying that operation to each element of a list and then sorting. So Qwen did recognize the high-level evolution: scalar → list + sorting. However, because it misunderstood the underlying operation (trailing vs leading zeros, and not clearly IP-specific), its understanding of *what* is being transformed is flawed, even though the *pattern* of transformation (map over list + sort) is correct. This partial grasp justifies a middling score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is minimal in terms of semantics: the helper function is named `removezero_ip` in the new solution, which actually gives away the intent, and the variable names like `a9_`, `c_4q`, `d5_w` are meaningless. Qwen correctly inferred that the code processes each element of a list and sorts the result, showing it can follow control flow and list comprehension despite obfuscated names. However, it failed to correctly interpret the regex `\\.[0]*` as targeting leading zeros after a dot, instead describing it as removing trailing zeros after a decimal point. This indicates that the main difficulty was not the obfuscated identifiers but misreading the regex semantics and the domain (IP addresses vs generic decimals). Thus robustness to obfuscation is limited: Qwen handled the structural aspects (list processing, sorting) but not the precise string transformation semantics.",

        "Misinterpreted the core string operation: described removal of trailing zeros instead of leading zeros after a dot.",

        "Lost the domain-specific nuance of normalizing IP octets rather than generic decimal formatting.",
        "Repeated the same semantic error (trailing vs leading zeros) in both raw and new problem descriptions, indicating a systematic misunderstanding of the regex."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen appears to track structural and control-flow aspects of the code reasonably well, even with obfuscated variable names: it correctly inferred the list-processing and sorting pattern. However, its understanding of fine-grained string semantics, particularly regex-based transformations, was weak here. It misread the pattern `\\.[0]*` and generalized the task to removing trailing zeros after a decimal point, losing both the directionality (leading vs trailing) and the IP-specific context. This suggests that while Qwen can handle obfuscation at the level of variable names and function composition, it may struggle with precise interpretation of string/regex logic and with inferring the intended domain when not explicitly stated."
