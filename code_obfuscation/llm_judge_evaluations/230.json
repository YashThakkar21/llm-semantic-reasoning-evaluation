      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the first digit of a given number. Code: `return int(str(n)[0])`. Qwen's description: \"extracts and returns the first digit of an integer n.\" This is perfectly aligned with the ground truth: it identifies the input (an integer n), the operation (extract first digit via string indexing), and the output (the first digit). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations. Semantic accuracy and completeness are both maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: \"find the sum of the first digits of a list of numbers.\" Code: `return sum(f1r5t_D1g1t(numb3r) for numb3r in numb3r5)`. Qwen's description: \"calculates the sum of the first digits of each number in the iterable numb3r5, using a function named f1r5t_D1g1t to extract the first digit of each number.\" This matches the ground truth exactly: it recognizes that the input is a collection (iterable/list) of numbers, that for each number the first digit is extracted (via the helper function), and that these first digits are summed. Qwen even notes the helper function's role, which is consistent with the raw problem. No important detail is missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about computing the first digit of a single number; the new problem is about summing the first digits over a collection of numbers. Qwen's two descriptions clearly reflect this evolution: first, a single-number first-digit extractor; second, a higher-level function that iterates over an iterable and uses that extractor to compute a sum. This shows a correct understanding of the relationship between the raw and new problems: the new solution composes the original functionality over multiple inputs and aggregates the results. Thus, the transformation from scalar to list/iterable and from single result to sum of results is fully captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `f1r5t_D1g1t` and `numb3r5`, Qwen correctly inferred their roles from the code structure: `f1r5t_D1g1t` is recognized as the first-digit function, and `numb3r5` as an iterable of numbers. The model did not rely on the misleading leetspeak naming but instead on the logic: a generator expression over `numb3r5` passed into `sum`, with each element processed by the helper. Similarly, for the raw code, it correctly interpreted `int(str(n)[0])` as extracting the first digit, not just some arbitrary string manipulation. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this problem.",

        "Accurate understanding of the transformation from single-number operation to aggregated operation over multiple numbers.",
        "Shows reliance on code structure (string conversion, indexing, generator expression, sum) rather than variable naming, demonstrating robustness to obfuscation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "No substantive weaknesses for this particular simple problem; the descriptions are already as complete and precise as the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this problem, Qwen demonstrates that it can fully recover the intended semantics of even very short, obfuscated code by focusing on the operations rather than names. It not only matches the ground truth descriptions but also clearly reflects the compositional relationship between the base function (first digit of one number) and the higher-order function (sum of first digits over many numbers). This suggests strong capability in understanding simple functional transformations and code reuse patterns despite obfuscation."
