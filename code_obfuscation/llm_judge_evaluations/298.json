    "detailed_analysis": {
      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is specifically about computing the wind chill index from wind velocity (km/h) and temperature (Celsius), then rounding to the next integer. Qwen's description says: \"The code calculates a specific formula involving variables q7_w and m2_k, rounds the result to the nearest integer, and returns it.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly recognizes that the code is computing a numeric formula of two inputs and rounding the result. However, it does not identify what the formula represents (wind chill index) nor the physical meaning or units of the inputs (wind velocity and temperature). It also does not mention the direction of rounding (\"next\" vs \"nearest\"), though the code uses round, so \"nearest\" is actually correct. Overall, Qwen captured the high-level behavior (apply formula to two inputs, round, return) but missed the domain semantics and parameter roles, so semantic accuracy is moderate and completeness is low.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth describes: given a list of (wind velocity, temperature) tuples, compute the average wind chill index over the list and round to the nearest integer. Qwen's description: \"The code computes the average result of applying a function f3_calc_z to pairs of values from p5_data_x, rounds the average to the nearest integer, and returns it.\" This is structurally and semantically accurate with respect to what the code does: it iterates over a list of pairs, applies a function to each pair, sums the results, divides by the length to get an average, and rounds the average. Qwen correctly understands the list structure, the per-pair computation via a helper function, the averaging, and the rounding. What it omits is the domain meaning (that f3_calc_z is the wind chill computation and the pairs are weather data with wind velocity and temperature). So the semantic accuracy regarding the algorithmic behavior is very high, but completeness is slightly reduced because it does not tie it back to \"wind chill index\" or weather data specifically.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: move from computing a single wind chill index for one (velocity, temperature) pair to computing the average wind chill index over a list of such pairs. Qwen's raw description: \"calculates a specific formula ... rounds the result\"; new description: \"computes the average result of applying a function ... to pairs of values from p5_data_x, rounds the average\". This shows that Qwen clearly understood that the new code generalizes the original computation by applying the same underlying function to multiple input pairs and then averaging. Even though it does not name the domain concept (wind chill), it correctly captures the structural relationship: the new problem is an aggregation (average) over repeated applications of the raw problem's computation. Thus, its understanding of the transformation is essentially correct.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like q7_w, m2_k, p5_data_x, and f3_calc_z, Qwen inferred the control flow and data flow correctly. It did not rely on variable names to guess semantics; instead, it described behavior in terms of \"pairs of values\" and \"applying a function\" and \"averaging\". For the raw problem, it correctly recognized a two-argument numeric formula and rounding. For the new problem, it correctly recognized iteration over a list of tuples, accumulation, averaging, and rounding. However, Qwen did not infer the higher-level domain semantics (wind chill, weather data) from the formula structure, which would have required recognizing the specific meteorological formula. That is a more advanced semantic leap and not strictly about handling obfuscation of names. Overall, it handled the obfuscation of identifiers well at the algorithmic level but did not reconstruct the domain context.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified that the raw code computes a numeric formula of two inputs and returns a rounded integer.",
        "Accurately described the new code as applying a helper function to each pair in a list, summing, averaging, and rounding the result.",
        "Captured the list-of-pairs structure and the aggregation pattern in the new problem.",
        "Understood the relationship between raw and new problems as averaging repeated applications of the same computation.",
        "Did not get misled by obfuscated variable names and instead focused on control and data flow."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to identify the specific domain semantics: that the formula is the wind chill index and the inputs are wind velocity and temperature.",
        "Did not mention units or physical meaning of inputs and outputs, which are explicit in the ground truth.",
        "Raw problem description is very generic and does not specify that there are exactly two inputs or their roles beyond being variables in a formula.",
        "New problem description omits that the list represents weather data and that the computed average is an average wind chill index."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid understanding of the structural and algorithmic semantics of the obfuscated code: it correctly recognizes per-element computation, accumulation, averaging, and rounding, and it understands that the new problem generalizes the raw one by aggregating multiple applications of the same function. However, it operates mostly at a syntactic/algorithmic level and does not recover the higher-level domain semantics (wind chill, weather data) that are evident from the original problem statement and the specific formula. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscated naming and can accurately describe what the code does computationally, it may not always infer domain-specific meaning from formulas alone, especially when identifiers are uninformative."
