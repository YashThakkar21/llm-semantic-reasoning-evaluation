      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: determine whether a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. The obfuscated raw solution is just `return n > 0 and n % 2 == 0`, which is actually incorrect for the ground truth problem (it only checks positive even numbers, not arbitrary sums of powers of two). Qwen's inferred description for the raw problem is: \"The code checks if a given number n is positive and even.\" This matches the actual semantics of the given code exactly, but does not match the ground truth task. Since the evaluation is against the ground truth description, Qwen's understanding is semantically incorrect relative to the intended problem: it says nothing about powers of two or sums, only positivity and evenness. Completeness is also minimal: it only states the simple condition and omits any notion of representation as powers of two, distinctness, or non-zero powers. Thus both semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are at the lowest level with respect to the ground truth.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of numbers, return a list of booleans indicating whether each number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. The obfuscated new solution is `return [is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(num) for num in numbers]`. Qwen's inferred new problem: \"The code generates a list indicating whether each number in the input list 'numbers' can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of two.\" This is very close to the ground truth: it correctly identifies that the input is a list, the output is a list of booleans, and the property checked is representability as a sum of powers of two. It also notes \"distinct\" powers of two, which is consistent with the usual interpretation of sums of powers of two and with the helper name `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two`. It does not explicitly mention \"non-zero\" powers of two, but that is a minor nuance; in practice, powers of two are normally taken as 2^k for k ≥ 0, so the omission is small. Overall, the semantic understanding and completeness for the new problem are good, only slightly short of perfect due to not explicitly capturing the \"non-zero\" constraint from the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "Ground truth transformation: from checking a single number for representability as a sum of non-zero powers of two, to checking a list of numbers and returning a list of booleans. Qwen's raw problem description does not mention powers of two at all, while its new problem description does. This means Qwen did not maintain a consistent semantic link between the raw and new problems: it effectively treated them as different tasks (raw: positivity and evenness; new: sum of powers of two). However, Qwen did correctly understand the structural transformation at the code level for the new problem: mapping a per-number predicate over a list to produce a list of booleans. So, in terms of understanding the raw→new evolution as \"lift the scalar check to a list\", Qwen partially captured this pattern, but because its raw semantics are wrong relative to the ground truth, the conceptual continuity of the transformation is broken. Hence a mid-level score is appropriate.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is minimal; the new solution uses a fairly clear helper name `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two`, which strongly hints at the intended semantics. Qwen leveraged that well in the new problem, correctly inferring the powers-of-two representation property and the list mapping behavior. For the raw problem, the code is a single simple boolean expression `n > 0 and n % 2 == 0`, with no misleading names. Qwen correctly described what that code does, but that is trivial and does not require robustness to obfuscation or deeper semantic inference. The main challenge in this item is not obfuscation but the mismatch between the provided raw solution and the ground truth problem. Qwen aligned with the literal code rather than the dataset's intended semantics. This shows that Qwen is good at reading what the code actually does, but not at reconciling that with an external ground truth when they differ. Overall robustness to obfuscation is moderate: strong on the new problem due to using the helper name and structure, but the raw problem offers no test of obfuscation resilience and reveals no attempt to infer the intended (but incorrectly implemented) behavior.",

        "Failed to align the raw problem description with the ground truth requirement about sums of non-zero powers of two.",

        "Did not maintain semantic continuity between raw and new problems (raw: evenness; new: powers of two), weakening the understanding of the transformation.",
        "Relied on the helper function name in the new solution rather than inferring any deeper algorithmic detail about how the check might be implemented."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen appears to prioritize faithfully describing the literal behavior of the given code over matching an external ground truth specification. For the raw problem, this leads to a correct description of an incorrect implementation, which scores poorly against the dataset's intended semantics. For the new problem, the presence of a descriptive helper name and a clear list comprehension structure allows Qwen to infer a problem statement that closely matches the ground truth. This suggests that Qwen is effective at understanding code structure and leveraging naming cues, but it does not attempt to reconcile inconsistencies between code and an implied or external specification. The transformation understanding is therefore structurally sound (scalar check lifted to list processing) but semantically inconsistent due to the mismatch in the raw problem understanding."
