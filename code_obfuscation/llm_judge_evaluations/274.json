      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description, \"Converts an angle from degrees to radians,\" matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is \"Write a function to convert degrees to radians.\" Both describe the same operation (degree → radian conversion) with the same input/output meaning and no missing constraints or nuances. The code snippet `return degree * math.pi / 180` is correctly summarized by Qwen. There are no inaccuracies or omissions here.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: given a list of angles in degrees, compute the sum of their radian equivalents and return the result rounded to two decimal places. Qwen's description: \"Converts a list of angles from degrees to radians, sums them up, and returns the rounded result to two decimal places\" captures every essential aspect: (1) input is a list of angles in degrees, (2) each is converted to radians, (3) they are summed, and (4) the result is rounded to two decimal places. This aligns perfectly with the provided obfuscated code, where `a7b_9x2z` sums `radian_degree(degree)` over the list and then `round(f5g_h6j, 2)`. No important detail is missing or misstated.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: single degree → radian conversion becomes list of degrees → convert each to radians → sum → round to two decimals. Qwen's new problem description clearly reflects this evolution: it extends the single-angle conversion to a list, adds aggregation (sum), and adds formatting (rounding to two decimals). This shows that Qwen correctly understood that the new problem builds on the original conversion function and adds higher-level operations rather than changing the core conversion logic. The relationship between raw and new problems is fully and correctly captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated naming (`a7b_9x2z`, `q8w_3rt`, `f5g_h6j`), Qwen correctly inferred the semantics from the structure: a generator expression applying `radian_degree(degree)` over `q8w_3rt`, summing the results, and rounding. It did not rely on variable names to guess behavior; instead, it followed the control flow and function calls. The presence of the separate conversion function and its reuse in the summation was correctly recognized as \"convert list of angles to radians, sum them, and round.\" This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this example.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfect semantic match for the raw problem (degree to radian conversion).",
        "Accurate and complete description of the new problem, including list input, summation, and rounding to two decimals.",
        "Clear understanding that the new problem builds on the original conversion function rather than redefining the core logic.",
        "Demonstrated ability to ignore misleading or meaningless variable/function names and instead reason from code structure and operations."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "None evident for this particular problem; the descriptions are already minimal and fully aligned with the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "On this problem, Qwen shows that when the code logic is straightforward, it can fully recover the intended semantics even with heavily obfuscated identifiers. It not only matches the base functionality (degree-to-radian conversion) but also correctly interprets the composition of that functionality over a list with aggregation and rounding. This suggests that Qwen is capable of reasoning from expressions, function calls, and control flow rather than relying on naming conventions, at least for simple numerical transformation tasks."
