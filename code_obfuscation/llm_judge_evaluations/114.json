      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is: find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. The obfuscated code clearly implements the classic DP for longest palindromic subsequence on q2_x8, treating it as a sequence and returning b3_k[0][n-1]. Qwen's inferred description: \"The code calculates the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the list q2_x8.\" Semantically this matches perfectly: it identifies that the operation is longest palindromic subsequence and that the output is its length. The only minor wording difference is calling q2_x8 a list instead of a string, but since strings are indexable sequences and the algorithm is the same, this does not change the semantics of what the function computes. It captures the core purpose, input, and output correctly and succinctly, so both semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: given a list of strings, compute the total length of the longest palindromic subsequence across all strings, i.e., sum the LPS length for each string. The obfuscated new solution is `return sum(t8_zq(f2_r) if f2_r else 0 for f2_r in y6_jm)`, which applies t8_zq (the LPS function) to each element of y6_jm and sums, skipping empty elements by contributing 0. Qwen's inference: \"The code computes the sum of the results of applying the function t8_zq to each element in the list y6_jm, returning 0 for empty elements.\" This is an exact description of what the code does structurally and matches the intended semantics of summing LPS lengths per element. The only thing Qwen does not explicitly say is that t8_zq is the longest palindromic subsequence-length function and that the elements are strings; it describes t8_zq generically as \"the function t8_zq\". So semantic accuracy is correct (it describes the behavior of the given code), but completeness is slightly lower because it omits the explicit connection to palindromic subsequences and to the domain (strings) that is present in the ground truth problem statement.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: go from computing the LPS length for a single string to computing the sum of LPS lengths over a list of strings. The new code is a straightforward higher-order application: iterate over the list y6_jm, apply t8_zq (the original LPS function) to each non-empty element, sum the results. Qwen's raw and new descriptions together show that it understood this evolution: first, it correctly identifies the raw code as computing the length of the longest palindromic subsequence; second, for the new code, it correctly identifies that the new function aggregates the results of t8_zq over a list, with a special case for empty elements. Even though Qwen does not restate that t8_zq is the LPS function in the new description, the relationship between raw and new is accurately captured: the new problem is a summation/aggregation of the raw problem's result over a collection. This matches the ground truth transformation very well.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (q2_x8, b3_k, t8_zq, y6_jm), Qwen relied on the control flow and indexing patterns to infer semantics. For the DP code, it recognized the classic longest palindromic subsequence recurrence: filling a 2D table from the end, base case 1 on the diagonal, matching characters adding 2 from inner subproblem, otherwise taking max of adjacent subproblems. This shows it was not misled by variable names. For the new solution, it correctly interpreted the generator expression and conditional `if f2_r else 0` and identified the summation pattern over a list. It did not confuse t8_zq with something else and correctly treated it as a function applied per element. The only minor gap is that in the new problem description it did not explicitly map t8_zq back to \"longest palindromic subsequence\" even though that is inferable from the raw solution; however, that is more a completeness issue than a failure due to obfuscation. Overall, its robustness to obfuscation is very strong here.",

        "Correctly identified the dynamic programming algorithm as computing the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.",
        "Accurately described the new solution as summing the results of applying the original function over a list, with a correct handling of empty elements.",
        "Showed clear understanding of the relationship between the raw and new problems: single-instance computation vs. aggregated computation over a collection.",
        "Was not thrown off by meaningless variable and function names; relied on structural and algorithmic patterns instead."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "In the new problem description, did not explicitly state that t8_zq computes the longest palindromic subsequence length, instead referring to it generically.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that the list elements are strings, which is part of the ground truth problem specification."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can recognize a well-known DP pattern (longest palindromic subsequence) purely from control flow and index relations, even when all identifiers are obfuscated. It also demonstrates that Qwen can track how a base function is reused in a higher-order context (mapping and summing over a list) and relate that to a transformed problem statement. The minor omissions in the new problem description suggest that while Qwen is strong at describing what the code does structurally, it sometimes stops short of re-attaching higher-level semantic labels (like \"palindromic subsequence\") to helper functions when they are referenced indirectly."
