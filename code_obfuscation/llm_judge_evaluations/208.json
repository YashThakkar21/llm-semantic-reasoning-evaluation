      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: remove all *whitespaces* from a string (using regex in the original, but conceptually all whitespace). Qwen: \"removes all spaces from the string stored in the variable x7z_4q.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly identifies that the function removes spaces from a string, and the obfuscated variable is just the input string. However, it narrows the behavior to spaces only, whereas the ground truth description is about all whitespace characters. The provided obfuscated code uses `replace(' ', '')`, which indeed only removes space characters, so Qwen is faithful to the actual code snippet but slightly less general than the ground truth description. It also omits mention of being a function and does not generalize beyond that specific variable. Hence, high semantic accuracy relative to the code, but slightly incomplete and a bit narrower than the ground truth intent.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of strings, remove all whitespaces from each string, then concatenate the processed strings into a single string separated by hyphens. Qwen: \"processes a list of strings, applies a function g8h_remove_2x to each element, and joins the results with hyphens.\" This matches the structure of the obfuscated code exactly: list input, per-element transformation, then hyphen-join. Qwen correctly captures the list processing and concatenation with hyphens. It does not explicitly restate that `g8h_remove_2x` removes whitespace, but that is not visible in the provided snippet; given the context, the core behavior of the new solution is accurately described. The only minor gap versus the ground truth is not explicitly stating that the per-element function removes whitespace, but the high-level semantics of the new problem are correctly captured.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about transforming a single string by removing whitespace; the new problem is about applying that same transformation to each element of a list of strings and then joining the results with hyphens. Qwen's raw description focuses on removing spaces from a string; its new description focuses on mapping a function over a list and joining with hyphens. This implicitly captures the transformation: the original operation is lifted from a single string to a list of strings and then aggregated. Even though Qwen does not explicitly say \"this is the same removal function applied element-wise,\" its description of the new problem as applying `g8h_remove_2x` to each element clearly reflects that understanding of composition and reuse. Thus, its grasp of the raw→new evolution is effectively complete.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `x7z_4q`, `g8h_remove_2x`, and `l5_strings_9z`, Qwen correctly inferred the roles of these variables and functions from the code structure: a single string input in the raw solution, and a list of strings plus a mapping and join in the new solution. It did not rely on names to infer semantics; instead, it read the operations (`replace`, list comprehension, `join`) and control flow. This shows strong robustness to obfuscation: it correctly identified the high-level behavior and data flow even though the identifiers were meaningless.",

        "Correctly identified that the raw solution removes spaces from a string input.",
        "Accurately described the new solution as processing a list of strings and joining transformed elements with hyphens.",
        "Captured the higher-order pattern of applying a function to each list element and then aggregating.",
        "Showed strong independence from variable and function names, relying on code structure instead.",
        "Implicitly reflected the reuse of the base transformation in the new problem."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Raw problem description narrows the behavior to spaces rather than general whitespace, slightly less aligned with the ground truth statement.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that `g8h_remove_2x` removes whitespace in the new problem description, losing a bit of semantic detail compared to the ground truth.",
        "Raw description is tied to a specific variable name (`x7z_4q`) rather than phrased generically as a function over arbitrary input strings."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates that it can infer the semantics of simple string-processing code even when identifiers are fully obfuscated, by focusing on concrete operations like `replace`, list comprehensions, and `join`. It also recognizes the structural transformation from a single-input function to a list-processing and aggregation pattern, which is central to understanding the raw→new problem evolution. The minor gaps are mostly about generality and explicit mention of \"whitespace\" vs. \"spaces,\" not about misunderstanding the core behavior. This suggests strong robustness to obfuscation and good semantic tracking of how a base operation is lifted to operate over collections."
