      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: compute the average of cubes of the first n natural numbers. Code: sum((a7b ** 3) for a7b in range(1, q9z + 1)) / q9z. Qwen's description: 'The code calculates the average of cubes of numbers from 1 to q9z.' This is semantically identical: it correctly identifies that cubes are taken, the range is 1..n, and the result is an average. It captures the core purpose, operations, input (q9z as n), and output. No important detail is missing or wrong.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: for a list of (start, end) tuples, for each tuple compute the average of the sums of cubes of the first n natural numbers for that range of n, returning a list of averages. The provided obfuscated new solution, however, is more generic: it sums r9_func(w1) over each integer in [start, end] and divides by the count, returning a list of these averages. Qwen's description: 'The code computes the average result of applying function r9_func to numbers within multiple specified ranges and returns a list of these averages.' This matches the actual obfuscated code exactly, but is more generic than the ground truth narrative about cubes of first n natural numbers. Relative to the given code, Qwen is semantically accurate: it correctly identifies that for each (start, end) range, the function applies r9_func to each integer in the range, sums the results, divides by the number of elements, and collects these averages in a list. It correctly notes multiple ranges and list output. However, it does not mention that r9_func is (in the dataset's intent) the 'sum of cubes of first n natural numbers'; it treats r9_func as an opaque function. So it misses the specific 'cubes of first n natural numbers' nuance present in the ground truth problem description, but that nuance is not visible in the snippet shown. Overall, for the new problem, Qwen's semantics are correct for the code but incomplete with respect to the dataset's intended mathematical meaning.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is 'average of cubes of first n natural numbers'; the new problem generalizes to handling multiple ranges and, conceptually, averages of sums of cubes for those ranges. Qwen's raw description matches the original single-range average-of-cubes task. For the new problem, Qwen correctly captures the structural transformation: moving from a single n to multiple ranges (list of tuples), computing an average per range, and returning a list of averages. This shows it understood the high-level evolution from a single-case computation to a batched, range-based computation. However, Qwen does not explicitly connect that the same underlying mathematical operation (cubes / sum of cubes) is being generalized; it instead describes the new code in terms of a generic r9_func. Thus, it partially captures the transformation (single to multiple ranges, scalar to list, per-range averaging) but misses the continuity of the specific mathematical operation across raw and new problems.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation is mostly in variable names (q9z, a7b, k7_ranges, b8_start, m2_end, p4_sum, x3_list, r9_func). Qwen ignores these names and relies on the control structure and operations: range(1, q9z+1), exponentiation **3, summation, division by count; and in the new code, iterating over (start, end) tuples, using range(start, end+1), summing function applications, dividing by (end - start + 1), and collecting results in a list. This shows strong robustness to naming obfuscation: Qwen correctly inferred that the code computes averages over ranges and did not get misled by meaningless identifiers. The only abstraction it left opaque is r9_func, which is reasonable given the snippet; it did not hallucinate a specific meaning for r9_func based solely on names. Overall, its semantic understanding is driven by structure and operations rather than names.",

        "Transformation explanation is implicit; it does not explicitly state that the same underlying operation from the raw problem is being generalized across ranges."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates that it can reliably extract semantic meaning from code even when identifiers are heavily obfuscated, by focusing on syntactic constructs like ranges, comprehensions, arithmetic operations, and aggregation patterns. For the raw problem, this leads to an exact match with the intended description. For the new problem, Qwen accurately captures the structural generalization (from single n to multiple ranges and from scalar to list of averages) but stays conservative about the inner function r9_func, describing it generically rather than tying it back to the original 'cubes' concept. This suggests that Qwen is strong at structural and control-flow understanding under obfuscation, but may not always infer or preserve higher-level domain semantics across related problem variants when those semantics are abstracted behind helper functions or not visible in the snippet."
