      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, Qwen's description matches the ground truth semantics almost exactly. Ground truth: \"round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.\" Qwen: \"calculates the sum of rounded elements in the list `b3_x`, multiplies this sum by the length of `b3_x`, and returns the result.\" The only difference is 'print' vs 'return', which is a minor I/O detail and not reflected in the provided code snippet (which indeed returns). Core purpose (round each element, sum them, multiply by list length) is fully captured. Inputs (a list), operations (round, sum, multiply by length), and output are all correctly understood. Hence semantic accuracy and completeness for the raw problem are both maximal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: list of lists; for each sublist, round every number, compute the sublist sum, then sum these sublist sums and multiply by the number of sublists. The obfuscated code does this via `f9_bad` applied to each element of `m4_list`, where each element is itself a list. Qwen's new-problem description: \"iterates over `m4_list`, applies a function `f9_bad` to each element, sums the results, multiplies the total by the length of `m4_list`, and returns the result.\" This is an accurate description of the code's behavior, but it is more implementation-centric and does not explicitly state that each element is a sublist of numbers and that `f9_bad` is doing rounding and summing of those sublists. So semantically, Qwen gets the high-level behavior (map with `f9_bad`, sum, multiply by length) correct, but it misses the explicit domain framing: \"list of lists of numbers\" and \"round every number in each sublist.\" Thus semantic accuracy is good but not perfect (it doesn't explicitly connect to the nested-list numeric structure), and completeness is lower because it omits the important detail that the elements are themselves lists of numbers and that rounding happens inside `f9_bad` on those inner lists.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new ground-truth problem is: extend from a single list of numbers to a list of lists, and from a single aggregate (sum of rounded elements * length) to applying that same operation per sublist and then aggregating those results. Qwen's raw-problem inference matches the raw code well. For the new problem, Qwen correctly recognizes that the outer function iterates over `m4_list`, applies `f9_bad` to each element, sums the results, and multiplies by the length of `m4_list`. This implicitly reflects the idea of reusing the raw-problem logic (`f9_bad`) on each element of the new input structure. However, Qwen does not explicitly articulate that the transformation is \"lifting\" the original operation from a single list to each sublist in a list of lists, nor that `f9_bad` embodies the raw problem's behavior. It understands the structural composition (outer loop + helper) but doesn't verbalize the conceptual evolution from raw to new problem in terms of nested lists and per-sublist rounding/summing. Hence a strong but not perfect score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`b3_x`, `m4_list`, `f9_bad`, `q7_w`, etc.), Qwen correctly inferred the core operations from the code structure: list comprehension with `round`, `sum`, `len`, and an accumulator loop. For the raw solution, it fully abstracted away from the names and captured the intended numeric operation. For the new solution, it correctly recognized the pattern of applying a helper to each element and aggregating the results, even though the helper name `f9_bad` and variable names are meaningless. The main gap is not due to obfuscation but due to staying close to the code-level description instead of restating the higher-level problem specification (list of lists of numbers, per-sublist rounding). This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation: Qwen relied on control flow and built-in functions rather than variable naming to infer semantics.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately captured the raw function's semantics: rounding each element, summing, and multiplying by the list length.",
        "Correctly described the control flow and aggregation pattern in the new solution (loop over `m4_list`, apply helper, sum, multiply by length).",
        "Did not get confused by obfuscated variable and function names; relied on operations like `round`, `sum`, `len`, and the loop structure.",
        "Recognized the reuse of the helper function `f9_bad` in the new solution and its role in computing per-element contributions."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "For the new problem, did not explicitly state that `m4_list` is a list of lists of numbers, and that each element passed to `f9_bad` is itself a list.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that `f9_bad` performs rounding of each number in the sublists in the new-problem description, losing an important semantic detail.",
        "Transformation explanation is implicit rather than explicit: it does not clearly articulate that the new problem is the raw problem applied to each sublist and then aggregated."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong code-semantic understanding even under obfuscation, especially for straightforward numeric and aggregation patterns. It reliably identifies the core operations (rounding, summing, multiplying by length) and the composition of helper functions and loops. However, when moving from code-level description to problem-level description, it tends to stay close to the implementation (\"apply f9_bad to each element\") rather than restating the higher-level domain semantics (\"each element is a sublist of numbers; round and sum each sublist\"). This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation and good at local semantic inference, it can under-specify the problem context and data structure semantics (e.g., 'list of lists of numbers') unless it explicitly chooses to generalize beyond the code structure."
