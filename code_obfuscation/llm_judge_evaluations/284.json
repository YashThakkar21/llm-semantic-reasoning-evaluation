      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: move all numbers to the end of the given string. Qwen: 'separates digits and non-digits from the string `z3_test`, then concatenates the non-digit part with the digit part.' This is exactly the same semantics, just described in more implementation-oriented terms. It correctly captures the core purpose (reordering characters so that non-digits come first and digits are moved to the end), the input (a string), and the output (a transformed string). No important detail is missing for the raw problem; the description is fully aligned with the ground truth intent.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: for a list of strings, move all numbers to the end of each string and then concatenate all modified strings into a single string. Qwen: 'defines a function `m4_v8n` that separates digits and non-digits from a given string, concatenates the non-digit part with the digit part, and applies this function to each element in `p5_list`, returning a list of concatenated strings.' Qwen correctly understands the per-string transformation and that it is applied to each element of the list. However, it misidentifies the final output type: the actual code returns `''.join(m4_v8n(w2) for w2 in p5_list)`, i.e., a single concatenated string, not a list. So Qwen misses the final concatenation across the list and thus the exact output structure. Semantically it's close on the core operation but incorrect on the final result, so accuracy is slightly reduced and completeness is notably reduced because an important aspect (final join into one string) is omitted/misrepresented.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: extend from a single-string operation to (1) apply that operation to each string in a list, and (2) concatenate all resulting strings into one string. Qwen captures the first part well: it recognizes that the helper function is applied to each element in `p5_list`. It also preserves the same per-string semantics as in the raw problem. However, it misunderstands the second part, claiming the function 'returns a list of concatenated strings' instead of a single concatenated string. So Qwen partially understands the transformation (lifting to a list and mapping the function) but misses the final reduction step (joining into one string). This merits a good but not perfect score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`m4_v8n`, `p5_list`, `z3_test`, `q9`), Qwen correctly inferred the logic from the code structure: using `q9.isdigit()` and its negation in two comprehensions, then concatenating the results. It did not rely on variable names to infer semantics. For the new solution, it correctly saw that `m4_v8n` is applied to each element in `p5_list`. The one error (claiming a list is returned) is not due to obfuscation but to misreading the final `''.join(...)` as producing a list rather than a string. Overall, Qwen shows strong robustness to obfuscation: it understood the core behavior and data flow from the control and comprehension structure, not from names.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately captured the core behavior of moving digits to the end of a string in the raw problem.",
        "Recognized the separation of digits and non-digits via `isdigit()` and recombination order.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mischaracterized the final output of the new problem as a list instead of a single concatenated string.",
        "Did not explicitly mention that all modified strings are concatenated into one string, missing a key nuance of the new problem.",
        "Transformation description omits the reduction step (global concatenation) that distinguishes the new problem from a simple map operation."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of per-string transformations even under obfuscation, correctly interpreting the role of `isdigit()` and the generator expressions. It also correctly tracks the introduction of a helper function and its application over a list. The main failure point is at the aggregation step: it overlooks or misinterprets the `''.join(...)` around the generator, leading to an incorrect output type and incomplete description of the new problem's final requirement. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to naming obfuscation and good at local semantics, it can still slip on global data-flow details like final aggregation or return type when they are expressed succinctly (e.g., a join over a generator)."
