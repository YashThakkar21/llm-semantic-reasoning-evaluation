      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. Ground truth: 'Write a function to find the median of three numbers.' Qwen: 'finds the median of three numbers by sorting them and returning the middle one.' It correctly identifies the purpose (median of three numbers), the input/output behavior, and even the specific algorithm used (sorting and taking the middle element). There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: 'Given a list of integers, write a function to find the median of each triplet in the list and return a list of these medians. If the list length is not a multiple of three, ignore the remaining elements.' Qwen's description: 'processes a list by dividing it into groups of three consecutive elements, calculates the median for each group using a function named 'median_numbers', and returns a list of these medians.' This captures all essential aspects: operating on a list, grouping into triplets of consecutive elements, computing the median per triplet via the helper function, and returning a list of medians. The behavior of ignoring leftover elements when the length is not a multiple of three is implicitly captured by 'dividing it into groups of three consecutive elements' and matches the loop bounds in the code. No important detail is missing or incorrect.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from computing the median of a single triplet of numbers to applying that same operation across all triplets in a list and aggregating the results. Qwen clearly reflects this relationship: it explicitly mentions using a function named 'median_numbers' (the raw problem's functionality) inside a loop over groups of three elements from the list, and returning a list of medians. This shows it understood that the new problem generalizes and reuses the original operation as a building block. Thus, its understanding of the raw→new transformation is fully correct.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names like 'x9z_2q' and 'w8_r3t', Qwen correctly inferred the logic from the control structure and indexing: a for-loop stepping by 3 from 0 to a length adjusted by 'len(lst) % 3', and calls to 'median_numbers' with 'lst[w8_r3t], lst[w8_r3t+1], lst[w8_r3t+2]'. It did not rely on names to infer semantics but instead used the loop pattern and slicing behavior to deduce that the list is partitioned into triplets and that any trailing elements are ignored. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the purpose of the raw function as computing the median of three numbers, including the specific method (sorting and taking the middle element).",
        "Accurately described the new function's behavior of grouping the list into triplets, computing medians, and returning a list of results.",
        "Implicitly captured the 'ignore remaining elements' behavior by recognizing the loop bounds and triplet grouping.",
        "Correctly recognized and articulated the reuse of the raw problem's functionality ('median_numbers') in the new problem.",
        "Showed no dependence on variable naming; relied on code structure and indexing patterns instead."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "No substantive weaknesses in this instance; the description could be slightly more explicit about ignoring leftover elements, but the behavior is already correctly implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can fully recover the intended semantics of simple but slightly obfuscated code by focusing on structural patterns (loop ranges, step sizes, indexing) rather than variable names. It not only understood the standalone behavior of each snippet but also the compositional relationship between them: the new problem is a list-wise application of the original median-of-three operation. The alignment between its inferred descriptions and the ground truth is essentially perfect, indicating strong semantic understanding and robustness to naming obfuscation for this class of problems."
