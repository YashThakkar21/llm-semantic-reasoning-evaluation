      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list. Code: return max(abs(x * y) for x, y in list1). Qwen: \"The code calculates the maximum absolute product of pairs of numbers from a given list.\" This matches the semantics exactly: it notes maximum, absolute, product, pairs of numbers, and that the input is a list. There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations. The description is both semantically accurate and complete relative to the ground truth.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: list of lists of tuples; each tuple has two numbers; we want the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples across all sublists, returning the maximum product found. Code: return max(max_product_tuple(sublist) for sublist in nested_list), where max_product_tuple presumably implements the raw behavior on a single sublist. Qwen: \"The code finds the maximum product from sublists within a nested list, using a function named max_product_tuple to calculate the product of each sublist.\" Qwen correctly identifies the nested structure and that it aggregates over sublists using max_product_tuple. However, it omits two important nuances: (1) that the product is an absolute product, and (2) that the sublists contain tuples of two numbers (it just says \"product of each sublist\" rather than clarifying it's the max absolute product of tuple pairs within each sublist). So the high-level idea (max over sublists using a helper) is right, but some key details from the ground truth are missing.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new is: extend from a flat list of tuples to a nested list (list of lists of tuples), and then take the maximum (absolute) product across all sublists by applying the original logic per sublist. Qwen's new description reflects this structural transformation: it explicitly mentions \"sublists within a nested list\" and that max_product_tuple is used to compute a product per sublist, then a maximum is taken. This shows it understood that the new problem wraps the original functionality and aggregates over sublists. However, it did not explicitly connect that max_product_tuple is the same logic as the raw problem (max absolute product of tuple pairs), nor did it mention the \"absolute\" aspect in the transformed problem. So it captured the structural relationship (nesting and reuse of the helper) but missed some semantic continuity (absolute value and tuple-pair nature).",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the prompt context emphasizes obfuscation, the provided code snippets are very clear and minimally named. Nonetheless, Qwen's behavior indicates it relied on the code structure and operations rather than names. For the raw solution, it correctly inferred that abs(x * y) over (x, y) in list1 means an absolute product of pairs from a list. For the new solution, it correctly recognized a nested list pattern and the use of a helper function per sublist, then a max over those results. The main omissions (absolute value and tuple structure in the new problem) are not due to misreading obfuscated identifiers but rather to under-specifying details in the natural language description. This suggests good robustness to naming issues and a solid grasp of the control/data flow.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfect semantic match for the raw problem: correctly identified maximum absolute product over pairs from a list.",
        "Accurately recognized the nested-list structure in the new problem and the role of max_product_tuple as a per-sublist computation.",

        "Demonstrated reliance on code structure and operations rather than variable names."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Omitted the \"absolute\" aspect of the product in the new problem description.",
        "Did not explicitly state that sublists contain tuples of two numbers and that the helper computes a max absolute product over those tuples.",
        "Did not clearly articulate that the new problem is a direct lifting of the raw problem to a nested-list context, reusing the same semantics per sublist."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong understanding of simple functional patterns like comprehensions and nested aggregation: it correctly interprets max(abs(x * y) for x, y in list1) and then recognizes the higher-order pattern max(f(sublist) for sublist in nested_list). Its main limitation here is not semantic misinterpretation but incomplete verbalization of all important details (absolute value, tuple structure) when the problem becomes slightly more layered. This suggests that for straightforward code, Qwen can robustly infer semantics even with unhelpful names, but its natural-language summaries may omit secondary but still important qualifiers unless they are explicitly emphasized."
