      "raw_problem_evaluation": "There is no inferred raw_problem description from Qwen at all (it's empty), so we cannot say it captured any of the semantics. The ground truth raw problem is to write a function that computes the volume of a cone using radius and height. While the obfuscated code clearly shows the cone volume formula (1/3 * pi * r^2 * h), Qwen provided no description, so semantic accuracy and completeness must be rated at the lowest level.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Similarly, Qwen's inferred new_problem description is empty. The ground truth new problem is to process a list of cones (each with radius and height), compute the total volume and the average volume per cone, and return both. The obfuscated code shows a function iterating over a list of cone dictionaries, summing volumes via volume_cone, and computing an average. Qwen did not provide any description of this behavior, so it did not demonstrate any understanding of the new problem semantics or its details.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from computing the volume of a single cone to aggregating over multiple cones and computing total and average volumes. Since Qwen did not provide any descriptions for either the raw or new problems, there is no evidence that it understood this evolution or the relationship between the two tasks. Thus, the transformation understanding must be rated at the minimum.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The code, despite obfuscated variable names, is structurally straightforward: a standard cone volume formula and a loop over a list of cone objects. However, because Qwen produced no inferred descriptions, we cannot attribute any robustness to obfuscation. The failure here is not a subtle misinterpretation but a complete absence of interpretation, so robustness to obfuscation is effectively zero in this instance.",

        "No semantic description of the raw problem was provided, despite clear mathematical structure in the code.",
        "No semantic description of the new problem was provided, despite an obvious iteration over a list of cones and aggregation of volumes.",
        "No indication of understanding the shift from single-cone volume computation to multi-cone total and average computation.",
        "Did not demonstrate any ability to look past obfuscated variable names to infer the underlying algorithm."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this problem, the evaluation is dominated by the absence of any inferred descriptions from Qwen. The obfuscated code is relatively simple and would normally allow a model to infer that it computes cone volumes and then aggregates them over a list. Because Qwen returned nothing, we cannot assess partial understanding or subtle errors; instead, this instance highlights a failure mode where the model does not produce an analysis at all, leading to minimum scores across all dimensions. This suggests that beyond semantic reasoning, robustness also depends on reliably generating some interpretation rather than failing silently."
