      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is: 'Write a function to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list.' The obfuscated solution is `return [x9z_ for x9z_, _ in groupby(nums)]`. Qwen's inferred description is: 'The code snippet removes consecutive duplicates from a list named 'nums'.' This matches the semantics exactly: it correctly identifies that the operation is on a list, that the duplicates are consecutive, and that the purpose is to remove them. It also correctly reflects the input/output behavior implied by the one-liner. There are no missing constraints or nuances in the ground truth beyond that, so the description is both semantically accurate and complete for the raw problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: 'Given a list of lists, remove consecutive duplicates from each sublist and then return a new list that contains the sum of the elements of each sublist.' The obfuscated new solution shows two parts: a helper `consecutive_duplicates` (implicitly the same as the raw solution) and a function `a8f_q2r_t7k_w3m_p5n_j1s(l4h_o6v_b9x)` that returns `[sum(consecutive_duplicates(u2d_g8w)) for u2d_g8w in l4h_o6v_b9x]`. So the intended semantics are: for each sublist, first remove consecutive duplicates, then sum the resulting elements, and collect these sums into a new list. Qwen's inferred description: 'The code snippet calculates the sum of consecutive duplicates for each sublist in a list of lists named 'l4h_o6v_b9x'.' This is partially correct but imprecise. It correctly identifies that the input is a list of lists and that a sum is computed per sublist. However, it misphrases the operation as 'sum of consecutive duplicates', which suggests summing only the duplicate runs rather than 'sum of the sublist after removing consecutive duplicates'. It also omits the explicit two-step nature (deduplicate then sum) and doesn't clearly state that the output is a list of these sums. Thus, while the high-level idea (per-sublist summation after some consecutive-duplicate-related processing) is captured, the key nuance of 'remove consecutive duplicates from each sublist, then sum the resulting sublist' is not clearly or accurately expressed.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is: start with a function that removes consecutive duplicates from a single list; then extend this to a higher-order operation over a list of lists, where you apply the same deduplication to each sublist and then aggregate via summation, returning a list of sums. Qwen's raw description is accurate, and its new description recognizes that the new problem operates on a list of lists and involves summation per sublist. However, it does not clearly articulate that the raw operation (removing consecutive duplicates) is being reused as a subroutine on each sublist before summing. Instead, it compresses this into 'sum of consecutive duplicates', which blurs the relationship between the original operation and the new one. So Qwen partially understands the evolution (from single list to list of lists with an added aggregation step) but misses the precise 'apply raw function then sum' structure.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mainly in variable and function names (`a8f_q2r_t7k_w3m_p5n_j1s`, `l4h_o6v_b9x`, `u2d_g8w`), but the structural logic is straightforward: a list comprehension over sublists, calling `sum(consecutive_duplicates(sublist))`. Qwen correctly ignored the meaningless names and inferred that `l4h_o6v_b9x` is a list of lists and that the comprehension produces a per-sublist sum. For the raw snippet, it also correctly inferred the semantics of the `groupby` pattern despite the obfuscated loop variable name. The main error is conceptual (misstating 'sum of consecutive duplicates' instead of 'sum after removing consecutive duplicates'), not due to being misled by the obfuscation. This indicates reasonably good robustness to obfuscation, with the remaining gap being a subtle semantic nuance rather than a failure to parse the code structure.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Mischaracterized the new problem as computing 'sum of consecutive duplicates' rather than 'sum after removing consecutive duplicates', which changes the implied algorithm.",
        "Did not explicitly state that the raw operation (removing consecutive duplicates) is applied to each sublist before summation.",
        "Did not clearly describe the output type for the new problem as 'a list containing the sum of each processed sublist'."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong understanding of simple functional patterns like `groupby` for deduplication and list comprehensions with `sum`, even under obfuscated naming. It accurately captured the base operation and recognized the structural extension to a list-of-lists scenario. The main limitation appears in articulating multi-step transformations: while it sensed that consecutive-duplicate handling and summation are both involved, it compressed them into a slightly incorrect phrase ('sum of consecutive duplicates'), losing the precise order and effect of operations. This suggests that Qwen can follow code structure well but may sometimes under-specify or loosely phrase composite behaviors, especially when a helper function's semantics are implied rather than shown explicitly."
