      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, the ground truth is: 'Write a function to subtract two lists element-wise.' The obfuscated code is a straightforward list comprehension using zip to subtract corresponding elements of q7w_3 and r6v_4. Qwen's description: 'The code snippet calculates the element-wise difference between two lists, q7w_3 and r6v_4.' This matches the semantics exactly: it identifies that there are two lists, that the operation is element-wise, and that the operation is subtraction (difference). There are no missing details relative to the ground truth description, so both semantic accuracy and completeness are fully satisfied.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem: 'Given a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two lists, write a function to subtract the second list from the first list element-wise for each sublist and return a list of the results.' The obfuscated new solution: 'return [m5n_7(k4j_8[0], k4j_8[1]) for k4j_8 in p3h_9]' clearly maps each pair (k4j_8[0], k4j_8[1]) in p3h_9 through m5n_7, which, from the raw problem, is the element-wise subtraction function. So the intended semantics are: for each pair of lists in the outer list, compute their element-wise difference using m5n_7 and collect the results. Qwen's description: 'The code snippet applies a function m5n_7 to pairs of elements from a list of tuples or lists, p3h_9.' This captures that p3h_9 is a list of pairs and that m5n_7 is applied to each pair, but it does not state what m5n_7 does (element-wise subtraction) nor that the pairs are themselves lists whose elements are subtracted. It also omits the constraint 'each sublist contains exactly two lists' and the fact that the result is a list of element-wise subtraction results. Thus, while the structural mapping (apply a function to each pair) is correct, the core semantic purpose (batch element-wise list subtraction) is only partially captured. Hence medium semantic accuracy and low completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: take the basic operation (element-wise subtraction of two lists) and lift it to operate over a collection of such pairs, returning a list of results. Qwen's raw description correctly identifies the base operation. In the new description, Qwen recognizes that the new code applies m5n_7 to each pair in a list of pairs, which reflects the structural transformation (mapping the base function over a collection). However, Qwen does not explicitly connect that m5n_7 is the previously defined element-wise subtraction, nor does it articulate that the new problem is 'do the same subtraction, but for each pair in a list of pairs.' So Qwen partially understands the transformation pattern (map a binary function over a list of pairs) but misses the explicit semantic continuity (still element-wise list subtraction). This merits a mid-level score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mild: variable and function names are meaningless, but the structure is simple. In the raw solution, Qwen relied correctly on the list comprehension and zip pattern to infer 'element-wise difference between two lists,' showing it did not depend on names at all. In the new solution, Qwen correctly inferred that p3h_9 is a list of tuples or lists and that each k4j_8 is a pair whose elements are passed to m5n_7. This shows good structural understanding despite obfuscated names. However, Qwen stopped at a generic 'applies a function to pairs' and did not leverage the context from the raw problem (that m5n_7 is subtraction) to give a more specific semantic description. So robustness to obfuscation is good but not perfect: it understands structure well, but does not fully integrate cross-snippet semantics.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the element-wise subtraction behavior in the raw problem despite obfuscated variable names.",
        "Correctly recognized that the new code iterates over a list of pairs and applies a binary function to each pair.",
        "Did not rely on variable names; instead used code structure (zip, list comprehension, indexing) to infer behavior.",
        "Captured the mapping pattern in the new solution (apply m5n_7 to each pair in p3h_9)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not specify that m5n_7 performs element-wise subtraction in the new problem description.",
        "Omitted the detail that each sublist contains exactly two lists and that the outputs are element-wise list differences.",
        "Did not explicitly connect the raw and new problems as 'batching' the same element-wise subtraction over multiple list pairs.",
        "New problem description is too generic and misses the core semantic purpose (subtract second list from first list for each pair)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong ability to parse and understand simple list-processing patterns even with obfuscated names, as seen in the accurate raw problem description. It also recognizes higher-order patterns like 'apply a function to each pair in a list of pairs.' However, it tends to describe the new problem at a structural level without fully propagating the semantic meaning of the underlying function from the raw context. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation and good at local code pattern recognition, it may underutilize cross-context information (e.g., what m5n_7 actually does) when summarizing more complex or composed behaviors. Strengthening that semantic linkage would improve completeness and transformation understanding."
