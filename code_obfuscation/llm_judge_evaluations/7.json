      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: remove the first and last occurrence of a given *character* from a string. Code: `s7x_2q = s7x_2q.replace(w9_m3k, '', 1); s7x_2q = s7x_2q[::-1].replace(w9_m3k, '', 1)[::-1]`. This indeed removes the first occurrence of `w9_m3k` from the original string, then reverses the string, removes the first occurrence (which corresponds to the last occurrence in the original), and reverses back. Qwen's description: \"removes the first occurrence of the substring w9_m3k from both the start and end of the string s7x_2q.\" Semantically, it captures that two occurrences are removed (one from the 'front' and one from the 'back'), and that `w9_m3k` is a substring being removed from `s7x_2q`. It slightly misphrases it as if they are strictly at the start and end positions, whereas the code removes the first and last *occurrences* wherever they appear. It also generalizes to substring instead of character, while the ground truth problem states 'character'. So the core behavior (first and last removal) is understood, but some nuances (occurrence vs literal ends, character vs substring) are off. Hence high but not perfect semantic accuracy and moderate completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: remove all occurrences of a given character from each string in a list, returning a new list of modified strings. New obfuscated code: `return [g4_r8z(p5_n1v, y2_t6h) for p5_n1v in k3_d9m]`. In the original (non-obfuscated) dataset, `g4_r8z` would be the helper that removes all occurrences of the character from a single string, and this comprehension applies it to each element of the list. Qwen's description: \"applies the function g4_r8z to each element in the list k3_d9m with the argument y2_t6h and returns a new list of the results.\" This is exactly what the visible code does, but it does not connect that `g4_r8z` is specifically a 'remove all occurrences of a given character from a string' function, nor that the input is a list of strings and the argument is a character to remove. So Qwen correctly describes the higher-order mapping behavior but misses the semantic intent of `g4_r8z` and the character-removal aspect. That yields moderate semantic accuracy and low completeness relative to the ground truth problem description.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: from operating on a single string (removing first and last occurrence of a character) to operating on a list of strings (removing all occurrences of a character from each). The new solution uses a helper to process each element. Qwen's raw inference focuses on removing a substring from the 'start and end' of a string; its new inference focuses on applying a function to each element of a list. It does recognize that the new code is a list comprehension applying a function elementwise and returning a new list, which is correct structurally. However, it does not articulate the semantic relationship between the two problems: that the new problem generalizes character-removal behavior to a list and changes from first/last occurrence to all occurrences. Thus, Qwen understands the structural transformation (single-item operation → mapped over list) but not the full semantic evolution of the task. This justifies a mid-level score for transformation understanding.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`s7x_2q`, `w9_m3k`, `g4_r8z`, `k3_d9m`), Qwen correctly inferred the operational structure from the code itself. For the raw solution, it recognized that `replace(..., '', 1)` followed by reverse/replace/reverse corresponds to two removals of the same substring, one from the 'front' and one from the 'back'. For the new solution, it correctly identified a list comprehension that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list. These show that Qwen relied on Python semantics and control flow rather than variable names. The main gaps are not due to obfuscation but due to not inferring the intended domain semantics (character vs substring, all occurrences vs first/last) and not tying the helper function's purpose back to the original problem statement. Overall, its robustness to obfuscation is strong, though it stays at a syntactic/structural level for the new problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified that the raw code removes two occurrences of the same pattern from a string using replace and string reversal.",
        "Recognized that the new code is a list comprehension applying a function to each element and returning a new list.",
        "Did not rely on variable names; instead, it used the code structure and Python built-ins to infer behavior.",
        "Captured the mapping pattern (per-element processing) in the new solution accurately."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mischaracterized the raw behavior as removing from the start and end positions rather than first and last occurrences wherever they appear.",
        "Did not mention that the ground truth is about a single character, instead describing a generic substring.",
        "Failed to connect the helper function g4_r8z to the specific semantic of 'remove all occurrences of a given character from a string'.",
        "Did not articulate the semantic relationship between the raw and new problems (change from first/last to all occurrences, and from single string to list of strings)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows solid understanding of low-level code semantics even under obfuscation: it can track string operations like replace and slicing, and it can correctly interpret list comprehensions and higher-order application patterns. However, it tends to describe what the code literally does in structural terms and often stops short of inferring the full problem-level intent, especially when that intent depends on understanding the role of helper functions or connecting multiple snippets. This leads to good robustness to obfuscation but only partial alignment with the original natural-language problem descriptions, particularly for the new problem where the key semantic (removing all occurrences of a character from each string) is not explicitly stated."
