      "raw_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth raw problem is to compute the n-th star number. The given formula in the obfuscated code is `6 * n * (n - 1) + 1`, which is exactly the standard formula for the n-th centered hexagram (star) number. Qwen described this as \"calculates the nth hexagonal number using the formula 6n(n-1) + 1.\" While it uses the term \"hexagonal\" instead of \"star\" or \"centered hexagram\", it clearly identifies the correct formula and the mapping from input n to that figurate number. Semantically, this matches the intended operation: given n, return that specific figurate number. There is no algorithmic or I/O misunderstanding; the only discrepancy is naming terminology, not behavior. Thus, in terms of semantic understanding of what the code does, Qwen is fully correct.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "The ground truth new problem is to compute the sum of the first k star numbers. The obfuscated code initializes an accumulator to 0, loops from 1 to k inclusive, calls `find_star_num` on each index, and adds the result to the accumulator, then returns it. Qwen's description: \"calculates the sum of star numbers from 1 to k by iterating through each number up to k, finding its star number using the function `find_star_num`, and accumulating the result\" matches this exactly. It captures the loop bounds (1 to k), the use of the helper function for each term, and the accumulation pattern. This is fully aligned with the ground truth semantics and includes all important aspects.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: originally, compute a single n-th star number; in the new version, compute the sum of the first k star numbers by repeatedly using that single-number function. Qwen's raw description recognizes that the base function computes a specific figurate number from n. Its new description explicitly states that the code iterates from 1 to k, calls `find_star_num` for each index, and sums the results. This shows a correct understanding that the new problem builds on the raw problem's functionality via repeated application and accumulation. The relationship between the two problems—single term vs. sum of first k terms—is correctly captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mainly in variable names (`o0O_o0`, `_l1Il`), but the structure is simple. Qwen correctly ignored misleading names and focused on the control flow and arithmetic: it recognized the mathematical formula in the raw solution and the loop-plus-accumulator pattern in the new solution. It also correctly inferred the role of `find_star_num` as the function computing the individual star numbers, despite not seeing its implementation in the new snippet. This indicates reliance on code structure and standard patterns rather than on naming semantics.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified the exact mathematical formula implemented in the raw solution.",
        "Accurately described the loop and accumulation logic in the new solution, including bounds and use of `find_star_num`.",
        "Understood the compositional relationship between the base function (single star number) and the new function (sum of first k star numbers).",
        "Was not misled by obfuscated variable names and focused on operations and control flow."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Used the term \"hexagonal number\" instead of explicitly saying \"star number\" or \"centered hexagram number\", which could be terminologically imprecise relative to the dataset's wording, though the formula is correct."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated strong semantic understanding by correctly mapping a compact arithmetic expression to its figurate-number meaning and by recognizing a standard summation pattern over a helper function. The minor terminology mismatch (hexagonal vs. star) did not affect its grasp of the code's behavior. Its performance suggests that, at least for straightforward arithmetic and loop constructs, it relies on structural and mathematical cues rather than on variable naming, and can correctly infer how a new function composes an existing one to form a more complex problem (sum of first k terms)."
