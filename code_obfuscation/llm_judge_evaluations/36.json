      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description, \"Calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius,\" matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is \"Write a function to find the volume of a sphere.\" Qwen correctly identifies the input (radius) and the operation (volume of a sphere). There are no missing details or inaccuracies; the mathematical formula is implicit in both descriptions and does not need to be restated in the problem description. This is fully aligned with the code snippet `return (4./3.) * math.pi * (r**3)`.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: \"Given a list of sphere radii, write a function to calculate the total volume of all spheres and the average volume of the spheres.\" Qwen's inference is: \"Calculates the total volume and average volume of spheres given a list of their radii.\" This is essentially a paraphrase of the ground truth with no semantic loss. It captures: (1) the input type (a list of radii), (2) the two outputs (total volume and average volume), and (3) that these are volumes of spheres. This matches the obfuscated implementation, where `k5_p2` is the sum of `volume_sphere(r)` over the list and `n8_q1` is the average, with a special case for an empty list returning 0 as the average. The description is complete and accurate.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem in the ground truth is: from computing the volume of a single sphere to computing aggregate statistics (total and average volume) over a list of spheres using that base function. Qwen's raw and new descriptions reflect exactly this evolution: the raw description is about a single sphere's volume; the new description is about total and average volumes over a list of radii. This shows that Qwen correctly understood that the new problem builds on the original function and extends it to handle collections and compute aggregate metrics, which mirrors the code where `volume_sphere` is reused inside a generator expression to compute the sum and then the average.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated naming (`x9z_2q8_w4r`, `a7b_3m`, `k5_p2`, `n8_q1`), Qwen correctly inferred the semantics by following the structure and operations: summing `volume_sphere(r)` for each element in the input list and then dividing by the length of the list with a conditional for the empty case. It did not rely on variable names to guess behavior; instead it interpreted the generator expression, `sum(...)`, and the division by `len(a7b_3m)` to identify total and average volume. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation, as the inferred description is precise and matches the intended behavior.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfect semantic match to the ground truth for the raw problem (single sphere volume).",
        "Perfect semantic and structural match for the new problem (total and average volumes over a list of radii).",
        "Accurately captured inputs and outputs, including that the input is a list of radii in the new problem.",
        "Correctly understood the relationship between the raw and new problems: the new problem extends the original function to aggregate over multiple spheres.",
        "Demonstrated independence from variable naming, relying instead on code structure and operations."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not mention the empty-list behavior (average volume is 0 when the list is empty), though this is a minor implementation detail not explicitly present in the ground truth problem statement.",
        "Did not explicitly mention the use of the mathematical constant pi or the exact formula, though this is also not required by the problem description."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen's performance on this problem shows that it can cleanly separate semantics from naming: even with fully obfuscated identifiers, it correctly inferred the high-level purpose and I/O behavior of the functions. The inferred descriptions are essentially ideal paraphrases of the ground truth, indicating that Qwen is tracking the control flow and arithmetic operations rather than guessing from names. The only omitted nuance is the specific handling of the empty list case, which is an implementation choice not emphasized in the original problem description. Overall, this example demonstrates strong robustness to obfuscation and excellent understanding of both the base computation and its extension to aggregated computations over collections."
