      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the median length of a trapezium, which is the average of the two bases. The obfuscated raw solution is simply `(base1 + base2) / 2`. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates and returns the average of two numbers, base1 and base2.\" Semantically, Qwen correctly identifies the operation (arithmetic mean of two inputs) but completely misses the geometric context (trapezium, median length). It treats it as a generic average of two numbers. So the core numerical operation is right, but the problem semantics (shape, meaning of parameters, what 'median length' is) are absent. Hence low semantic accuracy and minimal completeness.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of trapeziums (each defined by two bases and a height), compute the average median length across all trapeziums. That implies: for each tuple (base1, base2, height), compute the trapezium's median length (which depends only on the bases), then average those medians over the list. The obfuscated new solution loops over `q8_w3r_s`, unpacks three values, calls `g8_h9i(a1_2b, c3_4d, e5_6f)`, sums the results, and divides by the count. Qwen's description: \"The code calculates and returns the average result of applying the function g8_h9i to each tuple in the list q8_w3r_s, where each tuple contains three elements.\" This is structurally accurate: it recognizes a list of 3-element tuples, a per-tuple function application, summation, and averaging. However, it does not connect this to trapeziums, bases, height, or 'median length'; it treats `g8_h9i` as an opaque function. So it captures the control-flow and aggregation pattern but misses the domain semantics and the specific meaning of the three elements. Completeness is therefore limited.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: move from computing the median length of a single trapezium (average of two bases) to computing the average of those medians over a list of trapeziums, each given by (base1, base2, height). Conceptually, the new problem wraps the original operation in a map-then-average over a collection, with an extra (height) parameter that is part of the trapezium definition but not needed for the median length itself. Qwen's raw problem description is 'average of two numbers'; its new problem description is 'average of applying g8_h9i over a list of 3-element tuples'. It correctly recognizes that the new code is an aggregation of per-item computations, but it does not relate the new problem back to the original operation (median of two bases) or recognize that `g8_h9i` is essentially the earlier function extended to three parameters. It also misses that the third element is a height and that the core geometric quantity being averaged is the median length. Thus, Qwen partially understands the structural transformation (single computation → per-item computation over a list, then average) but not the semantic evolution of the problem.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`q8_w3r_s`, `g8_h9i`, etc.), Qwen correctly inferred the structural behavior of the code: iterating over a list of tuples, unpacking three elements, applying a function to each, summing, and dividing by the length to get an average. It did not rely on variable names to infer control flow or data flow. However, because the names are meaningless and there is no explicit reference to geometric concepts in the code, Qwen did not recover the domain semantics (trapezium, bases, height, median length). Its robustness is therefore good at the level of generic program structure and numeric operations, but weak at reconstructing the original problem context, which is not directly encoded in the obfuscated code.",

        "Correctly identified that the raw solution computes the arithmetic mean of two inputs.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to recognize or mention the geometric context of trapeziums and median length in both raw and new problems.",
        "Did not infer that the two numbers in the raw problem are trapezium bases and that their average is specifically the median length.",
        "Did not connect the new problem back to the raw one (i.e., that `g8_h9i` corresponds to computing a trapezium-related quantity, likely the median length, extended to three parameters).",
        "Missed the semantic role of the third element in each tuple (height) and its relation to the trapezium definition."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid understanding of low-level and mid-level code semantics—arithmetic operations, iteration over collections, tuple unpacking, function application, and aggregation—despite obfuscated identifiers. It can reliably describe what the code does in generic computational terms. However, when the original problem involves domain-specific semantics (geometry of trapeziums, meaning of 'median length'), and those semantics are not explicitly encoded in the code (only in variable names or external description), Qwen does not reconstruct them. As a result, it gives correct structural descriptions but loses the original problem's conceptual meaning. This highlights a gap between syntactic/structural code understanding and recovery of high-level domain intent when names and comments are removed or obfuscated."
