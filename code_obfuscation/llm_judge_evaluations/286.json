      "raw_problem_evaluation": "For the raw problem, Qwen's description matches the ground truth very well. The ground truth is: \"Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.\" Qwen says: \"The code calculates the median of two sorted arrays by merging them until the middle elements are found.\" This captures:\n- Correct input: two sorted arrays/lists of the same size (the \"same size\" constraint is implied by the algorithm and the use of n, though not explicitly restated).\n- Correct operation: effectively performs a merge-like process over the two sorted arrays.\n- Correct output: the median value of the combined data.\n- Correct algorithmic idea: it merges until the middle elements are found, which is exactly what the code does with the two pointers and the count up to n+1.\nThere are no substantive semantic errors or omissions for the raw problem; the description is accurate and sufficiently detailed for the task.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, there is a significant mismatch between Qwen's description and the ground truth. Ground truth: \"Given a list of sorted lists of the same size, find the median of the combined list formed by merging all the lists.\" That means: conceptually merge all elements from all lists into one big sorted list and take the global median.\n\nThe obfuscated new solution, however, does *not* actually implement that ground truth; it repeatedly takes medians of pairs of lists and replaces each pair with a singleton list containing that median, iterating until one value remains. Qwen describes exactly what the *code* does: \"The code finds the median of multiple sorted lists by iteratively merging pairs of lists and replacing them with their medians until only one list remains.\" This is an accurate description of the given obfuscated code, but it is *not* semantically equivalent to the ground truth problem. The final value is not the median of the fully merged multiset of all elements; it's some hierarchical/iterative aggregation of pairwise medians.\n\nThus:\n- Qwen correctly tracks the iterative pairwise process and the replacement with medians.\n- Qwen incorrectly characterizes this as \"finds the median of multiple sorted lists\" in the sense of the ground truth; it does not mention that this is not the true global median of the combined list.\n- It also misses the key ground-truth nuance that the intended operation is a full merge of all elements (conceptually) and then taking the median of that combined list.\nSo while Qwen understands the code, it does not align with the ground-truth problem statement, leading to low semantic accuracy and completeness relative to the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: from \"median of two sorted lists of same size\" to \"median of the combined list formed by merging all elements from many sorted lists of the same size.\" Conceptually, the new problem generalizes from 2 lists to k lists and still wants the true global median of all elements.\n\nQwen's inferred transformation is: from computing the median of two sorted arrays (raw) to a process where multiple lists are repeatedly paired, their medians computed using the two-list function, and each pair replaced by a singleton list containing that median, until one list/value remains. Qwen describes this correctly as an iterative pairwise median-reduction process.\n\nHowever, this is not the same conceptual transformation as in the ground truth:\n- Ground truth: generalization of the same median-of-union concept from 2 lists to many lists.\n- Qwen's description: hierarchical aggregation using medians as stand-ins for entire merged lists.\n\nQwen does correctly see that the new code reuses the two-list median function as a building block in a multi-list setting, but it does not recognize (or state) that this changes the semantics relative to the original problem and does not yield the true median of the union. Therefore, its understanding of the *relationship* between the raw and new problems is only partial: it sees the structural reuse but not the intended semantic generalization.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation here is mostly in variable naming (e.g., i7_x, jQ_2z, m3rg3d_7Yz, g3t_m3d1an_5Rx), but the control flow and operations are straightforward.\n\nFor the raw solution:\n- Qwen clearly ignored the meaningless names and correctly inferred the two-pointer merge process, the stopping condition (count up to n+1), and the final averaging of the two middle values. This shows good robustness to obfuscation for the simpler case.\n\nFor the new solution:\n- Qwen correctly identified that the outer loop runs while there is more than one list.\n- It correctly saw that lists are processed in pairs, that for each pair the helper median function is called with the two lists and their length, and that the result is wrapped in a singleton list and collected.\n- It also correctly noticed that an odd leftover list is carried forward unchanged.\n- It correctly concluded that the final result is the single value in the last remaining list.\n\nThese points show that Qwen is indeed reading the code structure and logic, not relying on names. However, it did not compare this behavior against the intended semantics of \"median of the combined list\"; it took the code's behavior at face value and labeled the result as \"finds the median of multiple sorted lists.\" So robustness to obfuscation is good at the level of code understanding, but weaker at aligning that understanding with the ground-truth problem intent.",

      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid low-level semantic understanding of obfuscated Python code: it correctly tracks loops, indices, and helper function usage even when names are meaningless. For the raw problem, this leads to a fully correct problem description. For the new problem, Qwen accurately describes what the obfuscated code *does*, but it implicitly assumes that this behavior matches the intended problem statement and labels the result as \"finding the median of multiple sorted lists.\" This reveals a gap between code-level understanding and alignment with a higher-level problem specification: Qwen is strong at reading and summarizing code behavior under obfuscation, but weaker at validating whether that behavior truly implements the intended algorithm (here, the global median of the union vs. a hierarchical median-of-medians style reduction)."
