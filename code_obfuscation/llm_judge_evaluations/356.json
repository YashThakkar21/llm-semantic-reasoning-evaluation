      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: convert a tuple string to an integer tuple. The code strips '(', ')', and '...' then splits on ', ' and converts each part to int, returning a tuple.\nQwen: \"Converts a string representation of a tuple, with potential unwanted characters, into an actual tuple of integers.\" This matches the semantics exactly: input is a string representation of a tuple, output is a tuple of integers. Qwen even notes the presence of unwanted characters, which aligns with the replace('(', '').replace(')', '').replace('...', '') logic. The only minor omission is not explicitly stating that the output is a Python tuple (though \"actual tuple of integers\" strongly implies that). Overall, the semantic understanding is fully correct; completeness is very high but slightly less than perfect because it doesn’t mention the specific formatting assumption (comma+space split).",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: Given a list of tuple strings, convert each to an integer tuple and then calculate the sum of all elements in the resulting list of tuples.\nCode: defines a helper m8_q2v_x that does the string→int-tuple conversion, then initializes p5_t8_w = 0, iterates over f7_y2_s (the list of strings), converts each string to a tuple, sums that tuple, and accumulates into p5_t8_w, finally returning the total sum.\nQwen: \"Sums up all the integers from multiple string representations of tuples contained within a list, after cleaning the strings of unwanted characters.\" This is exactly what the code and the ground truth describe: the input is a list of tuple strings, each is cleaned and converted, and all integers across all tuples are summed. Qwen captures both the per-string cleaning/conversion and the global summation over the list. It correctly identifies the list-of-strings input and the scalar sum output. This is fully semantically accurate and complete relative to the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about converting a single tuple string to an integer tuple. The new problem extends this to a list of such strings and adds an aggregation step: sum all integers across all converted tuples.\nQwen’s raw vs. new descriptions reflect exactly this evolution:\n- Raw: focus on converting a single string representation of a tuple into a tuple of integers, with cleaning.\n- New: focus on handling multiple such string representations in a list and summing all integers after conversion/cleaning.\nThis shows Qwen correctly understood that the new problem builds on the original function as a helper and adds iteration over a list plus aggregation. The relationship between the two problems (single conversion → batch processing + summation) is clearly captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated names (b4x_7q, a9z_3, m8_q2v_x, f7_y2_s, p5_t8_w, k3_r9_n) provide no semantic hints. Qwen’s descriptions rely purely on the operations: string replacement of parentheses and '...', splitting by ', ', converting to int, wrapping in tuple, iterating over a list, summing. Qwen correctly inferred:\n- The role of m8_q2v_x as a converter from string to integer tuple.\n- That f7_y2_s is a list of such strings.\n- That p5_t8_w is an accumulator for the total sum.\nIt did not appear misled by any naming and instead described the behavior at a high level that matches the code structure. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation.",

        "Accurately identified the core functionality of converting a tuple-like string into a tuple of integers.",
        "Correctly recognized the cleaning of unwanted characters ('(', ')', '...') from the string.",
        "Precisely understood the new problem as summing all integers from a list of such tuple strings after conversion.",
        "Captured the shift from single-instance processing to list-based aggregation in the raw→new transformation.",

        "Did not explicitly mention the exact splitting pattern (', ') or the assumption about input formatting, which is a minor detail.",
        "Did not explicitly state that the intermediate result in the new problem is a list of integer tuples before summation, though it is implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a strong ability to infer semantics from structure and operations rather than names. It correctly abstracted the helper function’s purpose and then the higher-level aggregation logic, even with fully obfuscated identifiers. The inferred problem descriptions align very closely with the ground truth, including the evolution from a simple conversion function to a list-processing and summation task. The minor omissions are about low-level formatting details rather than conceptual misunderstanding, indicating robust comprehension of the code’s intent."
