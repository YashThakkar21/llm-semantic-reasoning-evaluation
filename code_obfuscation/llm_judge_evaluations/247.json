      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's raw problem description — \"The code calculates the product of unique elements in the list b3_list_m\" — matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. The ground truth is \"calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\" Qwen correctly identifies: (1) the operation is a product, (2) it is applied over unique elements (corresponding to the use of set()), and (3) the input is a single list. There are no missing constraints or misinterpretations. This is fully accurate and complete for the raw problem.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, Qwen states: \"The code calculates the sum of products of unique elements for each sublist in t5_outer_list.\" The ground truth: \"Given a list of lists, each containing integers, ... calculate the product of the unique numbers in each sublist and then return the sum of these products.\" Qwen captures all essential aspects: (1) the input is a list of sublists (t5_outer_list), (2) for each sublist, it computes the product of unique elements (via the helper function using set and reduce), and (3) it sums these products. The only minor omission is not explicitly saying the elements are integers, but that is implicit from the context and not critical to understanding the algorithm. Overall, the semantic match is precise and complete.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a function that computes the product of unique elements in a single list to operate over a list of lists, applying the original function to each sublist and summing the results. Qwen's new-problem description clearly reflects this evolution: the inner operation (product of unique elements) is preserved, and the outer aggregation (sum over sublists) is added. This shows Qwen correctly understood that the new solution wraps the original logic in a helper function and then applies it across an outer list, aggregating with sum(). The relationship between raw and new problems is fully captured.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like b3_list_m, t5_outer_list, w8_func_z, a7x, and z9q, Qwen correctly inferred the semantics purely from structure: use of set() to enforce uniqueness, reduce with multiplication to compute a product, a helper function for per-sublist computation, and a generator expression inside sum() to aggregate over sublists. There is no evidence that Qwen relied on variable names; instead it followed the control flow and functional composition. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely identified the core operation as the product of unique elements using set and reduce.",
        "Correctly recognized the higher-level structure in the new problem: per-sublist computation plus summation over all sublists.",
        "Maintained alignment with the ground truth phrasing (\"product of unique elements\" / \"sum of products\") without introducing extraneous behavior.",
        "Showed clear understanding of the raw-to-new transformation: reusing the original logic as a helper and lifting it to a list-of-lists context.",
        "Was unaffected by misleading or meaningless variable names, relying instead on code structure."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention that the list elements are integers, though this is a very minor omission and not algorithmically significant."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can accurately recover the exact intended problem statement from very short, obfuscated code snippets when the logic is clear. It correctly interprets functional patterns (set + reduce + lambda multiplication, generator inside sum) and maps them to natural-language descriptions that align with the original dataset problems. The perfect alignment between Qwen's inferred descriptions and the ground truth, including the multi-level transformation from a single-list function to a list-of-lists aggregator, suggests strong semantic understanding that is not dependent on variable naming. The only omission (not stating element type) is negligible, indicating that for straightforward numeric algorithms, Qwen is highly robust to obfuscation and captures both core purpose and structural transformations accurately."
