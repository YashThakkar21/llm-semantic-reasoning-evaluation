      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the nth polite number (a specific integer sequence with a clear number-theoretic definition). The obfuscated raw solution is a known closed-form-ish formula for the nth polite number. Qwen's description: \"calculates a value based on the input 'n' using logarithmic operations, likely to determine a specific mathematical property or transformation of 'n'.\" This is extremely generic and does not identify that the function is computing the nth polite number or any sequence-related behavior. It only notes the presence of logarithms and a vague 'mathematical property'. It misses the input-output semantics (nth polite number), the discrete nature of the result, and the link to polite numbers. Thus semantic accuracy is very low, and completeness is minimal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the sum of the first n polite numbers, where a polite number is defined as a positive integer expressible as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The obfuscated new solution loops from 1 to m7pL_3 and sums bK4_vR9(zX9_w), where bK4_vR9 is the function that returns the nth polite number. Qwen's description: \"computes the sum of values returned by the function 'bK4_vR9' for each integer from 1 to 'm7pL_3', accumulating the result in 'a8d_fQ2'.\" At the code-structure level, this is accurate: it correctly identifies a loop from 1 to n, calling another function and summing results. However, it does not recognize that bK4_vR9 returns the nth polite number, nor that the overall result is the sum of the first n polite numbers. It also omits the definition of polite numbers and any number-theoretic context. So semantically, it captures the control-flow and accumulation pattern but not the true mathematical meaning. That merits a slightly higher score than the raw case, but still low for semantic and completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is from: \"find nth polite number\" to \"find the sum of the first n polite numbers\"—i.e., from a single-term sequence element to a partial sum of that sequence. Qwen's raw problem description does not identify the sequence or polite numbers at all, and its new problem description only describes a generic summation over a helper function. It does not connect that the helper function corresponds to the original raw problem, nor that the new problem is the cumulative sum of the original outputs. Therefore, Qwen fails to capture the conceptual relationship between raw and new problems and does not understand the intended transformation.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The variable names are obfuscated, but the structure of the new solution is straightforward: initialize an accumulator, loop from 1 to n, sum function outputs, return the total. Qwen correctly inferred this structural behavior despite obfuscation, indicating some robustness at the control-flow level. However, for the raw solution, Qwen only noted the presence of logarithms and a 'mathematical property', failing to infer that this formula corresponds to a specific integer sequence (nth polite number). It did not attempt to interpret the arithmetic and logarithmic pattern as a known sequence formula. Overall, Qwen handled the syntactic/structural aspects under obfuscation reasonably but did not penetrate to the deeper semantic meaning or the connection to polite numbers.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified that the new solution performs a summation over a range and accumulates results from a helper function.",
        "Recognized the use of logarithmic operations and arithmetic in the raw solution, at least at a superficial level.",
        "Showed some resilience to obfuscated variable names by focusing on the loop and accumulation structure in the new solution."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to recognize that the raw function computes the nth polite number or any specific integer sequence.",
        "Did not identify that the new function computes the sum of the first n polite numbers; it only described a generic sum of helper-function outputs.",
        "Missed the mathematical definition and properties of polite numbers entirely.",
        "Did not understand or articulate the relationship between the raw and new problems (single sequence element vs. partial sum of the sequence).",
        "Descriptions remained vague and generic, focusing on low-level operations rather than the high-level problem semantics."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen appears to rely heavily on explicit semantic cues (names, comments, or obvious patterns) to infer high-level problem meaning. When faced with obfuscated names and a non-trivial mathematical formula (for nth polite number), it defaulted to a generic description of 'some mathematical property' rather than attempting to map the formula to a known sequence or at least to a 'nth term of a sequence' concept. In contrast, for the new solution, Qwen accurately captured the control-flow pattern (loop + accumulation) despite obfuscation, but still did not connect it to the underlying domain concept (polite numbers) or to the original function. This suggests that Qwen is reasonably robust at understanding structural code behavior under obfuscation but struggles to infer deeper semantic intent, especially for compact mathematical formulas representing known sequences or properties."
