      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: compute the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. The provided raw solution code, however, only returns a single binomial coefficient C(2n, n-1) using a DP method. Qwen describes the raw solution as: \"The raw solution calculates the binomial coefficient C(2n, n-1) using dynamic programming.\" This is an accurate description of what the given raw code actually does, but it does not match the ground truth problem statement. Semantically, relative to the code, Qwen is correct: it identifies the exact binomial coefficient and the DP approach. Relative to the intended problem, it misses the idea of a sum and products of consecutive coefficients. Since the evaluation is about understanding the obfuscated code, Qwen correctly understood the code’s semantics but not the original problem’s semantics. For this task we compare to the ground truth problem description, so it only partially aligns: it captures binomial computation but not the \"sum of products\" aspect.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: for each integer k from 1 to n, compute the sum of the product C(2k, k) * C(2k+1, k+1). The obfuscated new solution clearly implements this: it loops z9_m from 1 to w3_p, and accumulates r5_t(2*z9_m, z9_m) * r5_t(2*z9_m+1, z9_m+1). Qwen’s new description: \"The new solution computes a sum involving products of binomial coefficients for a given range.\" This captures the core semantics at a high level: it recognizes a sum, products, binomial coefficients, and a range. However, it omits the specific pattern C(2k, k) and C(2k+1, k+1) and the exact loop bounds (k from 1 to n). So semantically it is broadly correct but not precise. Completeness is limited because the detailed structure of the coefficients and the exact index scheme are important aspects in the ground truth and are not mentioned.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation goes from a vague \"sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients\" to a precise definition: summing C(2k, k) * C(2k+1, k+1) for k from 1 to n. The raw code snippet given does not actually implement that sum; it only computes a single binomial coefficient C(2n, n-1). Qwen’s descriptions reflect this: for the raw version, it talks about computing a single binomial coefficient via DP; for the new version, it talks about a sum of products of binomial coefficients over a range. This shows that Qwen did recognize that the new solution introduces a summation over a range and involves products of binomial coefficients, which is directionally consistent with the ground truth transformation. However, Qwen does not explicitly articulate how the new problem refines or specializes the raw one, nor does it mention the specific consecutive pattern (C(2k, k), C(2k+1, k+1)). Thus, it partially captures the nature of the transformation (from single computation to a sum of products over a range) but misses the precise structural relationship.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (e.g., a8x_q, z9_m, w3_p, r5_t), Qwen correctly inferred that r5_t is a binomial coefficient function and that the code computes a sum of products of such coefficients over a loop. For the raw code, it correctly identified the DP computation of C(2n, n-1), including the parameters 2n and n-1, which requires reading the arithmetic in the call and understanding the DP array update pattern. For the new code, it recognized the overall pattern (sum, product, binomial coefficients, range) even though it did not spell out the exact indices. This indicates good robustness to obfuscation: Qwen relied on structural patterns (loop, accumulator, combinatorial function) rather than variable names. The main limitations are in precision and completeness, not in being misled by the obfuscation.",

        "Correctly identified that the raw solution computes a specific binomial coefficient C(2n, n-1) using dynamic programming.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not mention the key detail that the original problem is about sums of products of consecutive binomial coefficients, which is absent from the raw description.",
        "For the new problem, did not specify the exact form C(2k, k) * C(2k+1, k+1) or the precise loop bounds (k from 1 to n).",
        "Did not explicitly describe the relationship between the raw and new problems in terms of how the binomial patterns evolve.",
        "Descriptions are high-level and omit important structural nuances present in the ground truth (e.g., the exact consecutive nature of the coefficients)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid structural understanding of the obfuscated code: it can correctly identify dynamic programming for binomial coefficients and recognize a summation of products of such coefficients over a range, even when variable names are meaningless. Its main shortcomings lie in precision and completeness relative to the ground truth problem statements: it tends to give generic descriptions (\"sum involving products of binomial coefficients\") without pinning down the exact combinatorial forms and index relationships that define the problem more rigorously. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation and can infer broad semantics, it may need prompting or additional analysis steps to extract and articulate the exact mathematical structure implemented by the code."
