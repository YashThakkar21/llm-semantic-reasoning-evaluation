      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists (i.e., deduplicate across multiple lists). The actual raw solution code, however, returns [n for n in nums if nums.count(n)==1], which keeps only elements that appear exactly once in a single list, not a cross-list deduplication. Qwen's inferred description matches the given raw code perfectly: 'returns a list of elements from the input list nums that appear exactly once.' Semantically, relative to the ground truth problem statement, this is incorrect: the ground truth is about removing duplicates (keeping one copy of each value) across multiple lists, while Qwen describes filtering to elements with frequency == 1 in a single list. It also ignores the 'number of lists' aspect entirely. Thus, compared to the ground truth problem description, both the semantics and completeness are very low, even though Qwen correctly described the literal code snippet.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of lists of numbers, remove duplicates within each list and then return a single list of all unique numbers across all lists, with each number appearing at most once overall. The obfuscated new solution uses a set q9z_8x, iterates over y5u_2i, applies e4r_1a to each element, and updates the set, then returns list(q9z_8x). Qwen's inference: 'processes elements in the input iterable y5u_2i, applies a function e4r_1a to each element, collects unique results using a set, and returns them as a list.' This is an accurate description of the given code structure, but it is generic and does not mention lists of numbers, per-list deduplication, or the overall intent of merging unique numbers from multiple lists. It also doesn't clarify that e4r_1a likely returns an iterable of numbers (e.g., a list) that is being unioned into the set. Compared to the ground truth, Qwen misses the domain (numbers, list-of-lists) and the specific deduplication goal, but correctly captures the use of a set to collect unique elements from repeated updates. Hence, partial semantic alignment (unique aggregation) but missing key problem-specific details.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The ground truth transformation is from 'remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists' to 'given a list of lists of numbers, remove duplicates within each list and then return a single list of all unique numbers across all lists.' Conceptually, it's clarifying and tightening the original intent: explicitly list-of-lists, per-list deduplication, and global uniqueness. Qwen's raw problem inference is about elements appearing exactly once in a single list, and its new problem inference is about applying a function to each element of an iterable and collecting unique results. There is no recognition of the list-of-lists structure, no explicit mention of numbers, and no clear mapping from 'remove duplicates' to 'aggregate all unique numbers from all lists.' As a result, Qwen does not capture the intended evolution from a vague multi-list deduplication task to a precise list-of-lists unique-aggregation task. The relationship between raw and new problems in Qwen's view is essentially lost; they look like two unrelated generic tasks.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite the obfuscated names (y5u_2i, q9z_8x, e4r_1a), Qwen correctly inferred the operational semantics of the new solution: iterate over an iterable, apply a function, update a set, return list of the set. This shows it relied on code structure (.update on a set, for-loop, return list(set)) rather than variable names. Similarly, for the raw solution, Qwen precisely described the behavior of the list comprehension with nums.count(n)==1. However, it did not bridge from these low-level semantics to the higher-level problem domain (numbers, list-of-lists, deduplication across multiple lists). So robustness to obfuscation is moderate: Qwen understands the mechanics under obfuscation but fails to reconstruct the original problem specification.",

        "Accurately described the behavior of the raw code snippet: selecting elements that appear exactly once in the list.",
        "Correctly recognized the use of a set in the new solution to collect unique results and the pattern of iterating and updating the set.",
        "Did not rely on variable names; instead, it used structural cues (.update, for-loop, set, list conversion) to infer behavior."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to align the raw problem description with the ground truth intent of handling multiple lists and general deduplication rather than 'appear exactly once.'",
        "Did not identify that the new problem is about lists of numbers and merging unique numbers across all lists.",
        "Missed the list-of-lists structure and per-list deduplication aspect entirely.",
        "Did not capture the conceptual relationship between the raw and new problems; the inferred descriptions read as two unrelated generic tasks.",
        "Overly generic description for the new problem (iterable, function, set) without mapping to the specific domain and constraints in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates solid local semantic understanding of the given obfuscated code: it can correctly describe what each snippet does operationally, even with meaningless variable names. However, it appears to anchor its problem descriptions tightly to the literal code rather than to the higher-level, dataset-level problem statements. This leads to a mismatch when the ground truth problem description is more abstract or slightly different from the literal implementation (e.g., 'remove duplicates' vs. 'keep only elements that appear once'). For the new problem, Qwen captures the use of a set to aggregate unique values but does not infer the intended domain (numbers, list-of-lists) or the specific deduplication semantics across multiple lists. This suggests that while Qwen is robust to obfuscation at the code-structure level, it struggles to reconstruct the full original problem specification and the evolution from raw to new problem when only given the obfuscated implementation."
