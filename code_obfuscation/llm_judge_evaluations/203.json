      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: perform index-wise multiplication of elements in two tuples. The obfuscated raw solution, however, actually operates on two *lists* of tuples (`test_tup1_7k` and `test_tup2_3m`), zips them, and for each pair of tuples performs index-wise multiplication, returning a tuple of resulting tuples.\n\nQwen's inference: \"The code multiplies corresponding elements of pairs of tuples from two lists and returns a tuple of these multiplied tuples.\" This matches the *actual* obfuscated code very well: it correctly identifies that there are two lists, that each contains tuples, that pairs of tuples are taken, that elements are multiplied index-wise, and that the result is a tuple of tuples.\n\nHowever, compared against the *ground truth problem description*, Qwen's description is not aligned: the ground truth describes a simpler function on just two tuples, not on two lists of tuples. So semantically, relative to the ground truth, Qwen adds extra structure (two lists, multiple pairs) that is not in the original problem statement. Thus, while Qwen understood the given obfuscated code, it did not match the ground truth problem semantics. Hence a mid-level score for semantic accuracy and low completeness relative to the ground truth.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: given a list of tuples, where each element is a pair of tuples, perform index-wise multiplication for each pair, sum the products for each pair, and return a list of these sums.\n\nObfuscated new solution: iterates over `tuple_list_5m`, where each element is `(tup1_q9z, tup2_w7k)`, computes `tuple(a_8h2 * b_9k1 for a_8h2, b_9k1 in zip(...))`, then `sum(...)`, appends to `r3sult_8x`, and returns the list.\n\nQwen's inference: \"The code multiplies corresponding elements of pairs of tuples from a list, sums the results of each multiplication, and returns a list of these sums.\" This is essentially a perfect match to both the obfuscated code and the ground truth new problem: it captures that there is a list, that each element is a pair of tuples, that index-wise multiplication is done, that the products are summed per pair, and that a list of sums is returned. Both semantic accuracy and completeness relative to the ground truth are very high here.",
      "transformation_analysis": "Ground truth transformation: from a basic function that multiplies two tuples index-wise (single pair) to a more complex function that takes a list of such tuple-pairs, performs the same index-wise multiplication for each pair, then sums the products per pair and returns a list of sums.\n\nQwen's raw vs new descriptions:\n- Raw (Qwen): operates on two lists of tuples, returns a tuple of multiplied tuples.\n- New (Qwen): operates on a list of pairs of tuples, multiplies index-wise, sums each, returns a list of sums.\n\nQwen clearly understands that the new problem generalizes to processing multiple pairs and adds an aggregation step (summing) and changes the output structure (list of sums instead of a collection of tuples). That matches the intended evolution: from per-pair multiplication to per-pair multiplication plus reduction over many pairs.\n\nThe mismatch is that Qwen's raw description already assumes a batched/multi-pair setting (two lists of tuples), which is richer than the ground truth raw problem. Despite that, Qwen correctly captures the *relative* transformation: new problem adds summation and changes the container type and structure of the result. Hence a high, but not perfect, score.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "In both raw and new solutions, variable names are heavily obfuscated (`a9z_3x`, `b2_w8q`, `tuple_list_5m`, etc.). Qwen nonetheless correctly:\n- Identified the use of `zip` to pair corresponding elements.\n- Recognized generator expressions inside `tuple(...)` and `sum(...)`.\n- Understood the nesting: iterating over a list of pairs of tuples, then iterating over elements within each tuple.\n\nFor the new solution, Qwen's description is structurally and semantically precise, showing that it relied on control flow and operations rather than names. For the raw solution, Qwen also correctly described the actual obfuscated code (two lists of tuples, zipped, returning a tuple of multiplied tuples), which again indicates good robustness to naming obfuscation.\n\nThe only issue is not with obfuscation but with alignment to the ground truth raw problem, which appears simpler than the provided obfuscated raw code. From a code-understanding perspective, Qwen handled the obfuscation well.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Raw problem description does not align with the simpler ground truth statement; it assumes two lists of tuples instead of two tuples.",
        "Because of this, completeness relative to the ground truth raw problem is low: Qwen adds extra structural assumptions not present in the original description.",
        "Did not explicitly highlight that the raw ground truth problem is a single-pair operation, whereas its inferred description is multi-pair/batched."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong semantic understanding of the obfuscated Python code, especially in the new problem: it correctly interprets nested iteration, zipping, tuple construction, and summation, and maps them to a clear high-level description. Its robustness to obfuscation is evident: it ignores misleading names and relies on language constructs. The main discrepancy arises from a mismatch between the actual obfuscated raw code and the ground truth raw problem description; Qwen faithfully describes the code it sees, even when that goes beyond the simpler ground truth statement. This suggests that, as a code-understanding model, Qwen is strong at structural and algorithmic interpretation, but evaluation against external ground truth must account for possible differences between the original problem statement and the provided obfuscated implementation."
