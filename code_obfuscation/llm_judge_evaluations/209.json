      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw: sum of even factors of a number. Code: if number is odd, return 0; otherwise sum all even divisors. Qwen's inference: \"calculates the sum of even divisors of a given number 'a7x_9q' if it is even; otherwise, it returns 0.\" This matches the actual code semantics exactly: it correctly identifies that only even divisors are summed, and that for odd inputs the function returns 0. The only minor nuance not mentioned is that the range starts from 2 to n inclusive, but that is implicit in \"even divisors\". Overall, Qwen fully captured the semantic meaning of the raw solution.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new: given a list of numbers, compute the sum of even factors of each number in the list and return the total sum of these even factors. Obfuscated new solution: `return sum(w5_h2r(p9_t4x) for p9_t4x in n6_j1s)`. Given the context, `w5_h2r` is the previously defined function that sums even factors of a single number, and `n6_j1s` is an iterable of numbers. Qwen's inference: \"computes the sum of the results of applying the function 'w5_h2r' to each element in the iterable 'n6_j1s'.\" This is exactly what the code does at the structural level, but Qwen does not explicitly connect `w5_h2r` to \"sum of even factors\" or state that `n6_j1s` is a list of numbers. So semantically it's correct about the higher-order pattern (map then sum), but it omits the domain-specific meaning (even factors) and the input type. Thus accuracy is high but not perfect, and completeness is limited relative to the ground truth description.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a single-number function (sum of even factors of one integer) to a list-level function that applies this per element and aggregates the results. The new solution is a straightforward higher-order composition: `sum(w5_h2r(x) for x in n6_j1s)`. Qwen's new-problem description correctly captures this transformation pattern: it explicitly says the code \"computes the sum of the results of applying the function 'w5_h2r' to each element in the iterable 'n6_j1s'\", which is exactly the structural transformation from raw to new. However, it does not articulate that `w5_h2r` itself is the \"sum of even factors\" function, nor that the list elements are numbers, so the connection to the original problem's semantics is only implicit. Still, its understanding of the transformation pattern (lift scalar function to list and sum) is solid.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`a7x_9q`, `z3_k8m`, `w5_h2r`, `n6_j1s`), Qwen correctly inferred the semantics of the raw function: it identified even divisors, the conditional behavior for odd inputs, and the summation. This shows it relied on control flow and arithmetic conditions rather than names. For the new solution, it correctly recognized the pattern of applying a previously defined function to each element of an iterable and summing the results, again ignoring meaningless names. The only missing piece is not re-associating `w5_h2r` with its known meaning (sum of even factors) in the new-problem description, but that is more about cross-referencing than about handling obfuscation. Overall, its robustness to obfuscation is strong.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified that the raw function sums even divisors and returns 0 for odd inputs.",
        "Correctly interpreted the generator expression and sum in the new solution as applying a function to each element and aggregating.",
        "Showed clear reliance on code structure and arithmetic conditions rather than variable names.",
        "Captured the higher-order transformation pattern from single-element processing to list-level aggregation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly restate that 'w5_h2r' computes the sum of even factors when describing the new problem.",
        "Did not mention that the iterable 'n6_j1s' is specifically a list (or sequence) of numbers, as in the ground truth.",
        "New-problem description is structurally correct but lacks the domain-specific semantics present in the ground truth (\"even factors\")."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates strong semantic understanding of the obfuscated raw code, correctly inferring the notion of even divisors and the conditional behavior. For the new code, it focuses on the functional pattern (map a known function over an iterable and sum) rather than the domain semantics of that function. This indicates that Qwen is robust to obfuscation and good at recognizing structural transformations, but it does not always propagate previously inferred semantic meanings (like \"sum of even factors\") into subsequent higher-level descriptions unless prompted. The main gap is in completeness and explicitness of the new-problem description, not in core semantic understanding of the code."
