      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: compute the lateral surface area of a cylinder. The code is `return 2 * math.pi * r * h`. Qwen's inference: \"Calculates the lateral surface area of a single cylinder given its radius (r) and height (h).\" This matches perfectly: it identifies that it's lateral (not total) surface area, that it's for a single cylinder, and that the inputs are radius and height. There are no missing or incorrect semantic elements here.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: compute the total surface area of multiple cylinders, but specifically by summing the lateral surface areas of each cylinder using the provided `lateralsurface_cylinder` function. Qwen's inference: \"Calculates the total lateral surface area of multiple cylinders given a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cylinder.\" Semantically, this matches the actual code: the function iterates over a list of (r, h) tuples and sums `lateralsurface_cylinder(r, h)`. The only subtle difference is that the ground truth description uses the phrase \"total surface area\" but then clarifies that it is obtained by summing lateral surface areas; Qwen explicitly calls it \"total lateral surface area\", which is actually more precise with respect to the implementation. Qwen correctly identifies the input structure (list of tuples, each with radius and height) and the aggregation behavior (sum of lateral areas). The only minor completeness gap is that Qwen does not explicitly mention that it uses the helper function `lateralsurface_cylinder` by name, though its description clearly reflects that behavior.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: from computing the lateral surface area of a single cylinder to computing the total (sum) of lateral surface areas for multiple cylinders, using the original function as a helper. Qwen's raw problem description captures the single-cylinder lateral area correctly. Its new problem description captures that the new function handles multiple cylinders, takes a list of (r, h) tuples, and sums their lateral areas. This shows a correct understanding of how the new problem builds on the original one: scaling from one cylinder to many and aggregating results. Even though Qwen does not explicitly state \"uses the previously defined function\", the semantics of the transformation are fully understood.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscated code uses meaningless names like `a7b_9x2z`, `q8w_3rt`, `y5u_1op`, and `i4k_8mn`. Qwen ignores these names and instead infers behavior from the control flow and operations: iterating over the list, unpacking each element into `r, h`, calling `lateralsurface_cylinder(r, h)`, and accumulating the sum. It correctly identifies the input as a list of (radius, height) tuples and the output as the total lateral surface area. This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation: Qwen relies on structural and mathematical cues rather than variable naming.",
      "strengths": [
        "Perfectly identified the raw function as computing lateral surface area of a single cylinder from radius and height.",
        "Correctly recognized that the new function processes multiple cylinders and sums their lateral surface areas.",
        "Accurately described the input format for the new function as a list of (radius, height) tuples.",
        "Demonstrated independence from variable naming, focusing on code structure and operations.",
        "Clarified that the new function computes total lateral surface area, which aligns with the actual implementation."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention the use of the helper function `lateralsurface_cylinder` by name in the new problem description, which is a minor detail in the ground truth specification."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen shows strong semantic understanding even with trivial, highly obfuscated code. It correctly interprets mathematical formulas and loop-based aggregation, and it generalizes the relationship between the single-entity function and the multi-entity aggregator function. The only minor gap is in mirroring the exact phrasing and explicit reference to the helper function, but this does not affect its understanding of what the code does. This example suggests that Qwen relies on structural and mathematical semantics rather than naming, and can accurately track how a problem scales from a single instance to a collection-based variant."
