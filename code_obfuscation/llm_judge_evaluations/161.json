      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: find the maximum of two numbers. Code: `return max(a, b)`. Qwen's inference: \"returns the maximum value between two variables, a and b.\" This is perfectly aligned with the ground truth: it captures the core operation (max), the arity (two values), and the semantics (returns the maximum). No missing details or inaccuracies.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: find the maximum value in a list of tuples, each containing two numbers, returning the maximum value across all tuples. Obfuscated code initializes `g7h_9x` to negative infinity, iterates over `m8p_2r` (list of tuples), computes `t5k_4v(z3q_w[0], z3q_w[1])` (max of the two elements in the tuple), then updates `g7h_9x` with the max between the current global max and that tuple max, and finally returns `g7h_9x`. Qwen's inference: \"finds the maximum value among pairs of elements from a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements.\" This correctly captures that the input is a list of tuples/pairs and that a maximum is being computed over them. The only slight omission is that Qwen does not explicitly state that the result is the single maximum value across *all* elements in all tuples (though \"maximum value among pairs\" strongly implies this). It also doesn't explicitly mention the initial negative infinity or the iterative accumulation, but those are implementation details rather than problem-statement essentials. Overall, the semantics are correct and nearly complete, with only minor phrasing ambiguity.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is \"max of two numbers\"; the new problem generalizes this to a list of tuples, each containing two numbers, and asks for the maximum value across all of them. Qwen's raw inference matches the original raw problem exactly. For the new problem, Qwen recognizes that the function now operates on a list of tuples (pairs) and computes a maximum over these pairs. This shows it understood that the transformation is essentially lifting the binary max operation to a collection of pairs and aggregating to a global maximum. There is no indication of misunderstanding about the relationship between the two problems; the evolution from a simple two-argument max to a list-of-pairs max is correctly reflected.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names (`g7h_9x`, `m8p_2r`, `z3q_w`, `t5k_4v`), Qwen correctly inferred that: (1) `m8p_2r` is an iterable of tuples; (2) `z3q_w[0]` and `z3q_w[1]` are the two elements of each tuple; (3) `t5k_4v` behaves like `max`; (4) `g7h_9x` is an accumulator for the global maximum initialized to negative infinity. Its description abstracts away these names and focuses on the logical structure: iterating over tuples and computing a maximum across them. This indicates that Qwen relied on control flow and operations rather than variable naming, showing strong robustness to obfuscation.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "New problem description is slightly less explicit than the ground truth about returning the single maximum value across all tuples and all elements.",
        "Does not mention any edge cases or assumptions (e.g., non-empty list), though these are not explicit in the ground truth either."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates that it can abstract away from obfuscated variable names and focus on structural patterns: iteration over a collection, indexing into tuples, repeated application of a binary max-like function, and accumulation of a global maximum. Its descriptions for both the raw and new problems align very closely with the ground truth, and it correctly captures the conceptual transformation from a simple binary max to a max over a list of pairs. The minor gap is in phrasing precision for the new problem, but the underlying semantic understanding is strong."
