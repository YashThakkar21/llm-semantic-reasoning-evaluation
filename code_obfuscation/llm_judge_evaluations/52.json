      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: convert a decimal integer to its binary equivalent as a string with no leading zeros. Qwen: \"Converts an integer to its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix.\" Semantically, this matches the code exactly (bin(n).replace(\"0b\",\"\")), and for positive integers this also implies no leading zeros, since Python's bin() never produces leading zeros beyond the '0b' prefix. The only very minor gap is that Qwen phrases it in terms of removing the '0b' prefix rather than explicitly mentioning 'no leading zeros', but the behavior is equivalent for the intended domain. Hence semantic accuracy is perfect; completeness is slightly less than perfect only because it doesn't explicitly restate the 'no leading zeros' requirement, even though it's implied by the implementation.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of decimal numbers, convert each to binary, concatenate all binary strings, then remove any leading zeros from the final concatenated result. Qwen: \"Converts a list of decimal numbers to their binary representations, concatenates them into a single string, and removes leading zeros.\" This matches the provided obfuscated code exactly: list comprehension to get binaries, join, then lstrip('0') on the final string. Qwen captures the list input, per-element conversion, concatenation, and leading-zero stripping on the final result. There are no missing constraints or nuances relative to the ground truth. Both semantics and details are fully aligned.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: single integer → list of integers; single binary string → concatenated binary string; and in both cases, ensure no leading zeros in the final output. Qwen's new-problem description clearly reflects this evolution: it generalizes from one integer to a list, preserves the binary conversion step, and keeps the leading-zero removal at the final stage. It implicitly recognizes that the new problem is a batched/aggregated version of the original. Thus, Qwen correctly understands the relationship and transformation between the raw and new problems.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The code itself is extremely simple and not heavily obfuscated in structure, though variable names in the new solution (e.g., decimal_to_binary, decimal_list) are actually quite descriptive. Even so, Qwen's descriptions are tightly aligned with the actual operations: using bin(), removing the '0b' prefix, mapping over a list, joining strings, and stripping leading zeros from the final result. This indicates that Qwen is reasoning from the control flow and standard-library calls rather than relying on names. The obfuscation present did not hinder its ability to infer the correct semantics.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately captured the core semantics of both the raw and new problems.",
        "Correctly identified input and output types (integer vs. list of integers; string output).",
        "Precisely described the sequence of operations in the new problem: per-element conversion, concatenation, and final leading-zero removal.",
        "Clearly reflected the raw→new transformation as a generalization from single-value to list processing.",
        "Showed reliance on actual code behavior (bin, replace, lstrip, join) rather than variable naming."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention the \"no leading zeros\" requirement in the raw problem, instead framing it as removal of the '0b' prefix (though this is behaviorally equivalent for normal inputs).",
        "Did not discuss any edge cases (e.g., behavior for zero or negative numbers), though these were also not emphasized in the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a strong understanding of the semantics of simple numeric-to-binary transformations, even when described via minimal or slightly obfuscated code. It correctly generalized from a single-value conversion to a list-based, concatenated conversion while preserving the key property of removing leading zeros from the final representation. The small wording difference in the raw problem (focusing on the '0b' prefix rather than 'no leading zeros') shows that Qwen is closely tied to the literal implementation, but in this case that still yields the intended behavior. Overall, this example suggests that Qwen can robustly infer problem intent from straightforward code structure and standard-library usage, even when naming is not the primary cue."
