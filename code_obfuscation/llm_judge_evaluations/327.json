      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: sort a list of strings representing numbers numerically. Code: `return sorted([int(x) for x in nums_str])`. Qwen's inference: \"converts a list of numeric strings into integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list.\" This exactly matches the semantics: it notes the input type (numeric strings), the conversion to integers, the sorting, and the output (sorted list). It captures that the sort is numeric (via int conversion) rather than lexicographic. No important detail is missing or incorrect.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: given a list of lists of numeric strings, sort each sublist numerically and then return a list of the sums of the sorted sublists. Code: `return [sum(sort_numeric_strings(sublist)) for sublist in nums_str_lists]`. Qwen's inference: \"processes a list of lists containing numeric strings by sorting and summing each sublist's numeric values, then returns a list of these sums.\" This matches perfectly: it recognizes the nested list structure, that each sublist is sorted numerically (implicitly via reuse of the earlier function), that each sublist is then summed, and that the final result is a list of sums. The mention of \"numeric values\" correctly reflects the conversion from strings to ints in the helper. The description is fully aligned with the ground truth.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about a single list of numeric strings being converted to integers and sorted. The new problem lifts this to a higher level: a list of such lists, where each sublist is processed as in the raw problem and then reduced via sum, returning a list of these reductions. Qwen's new-problem description clearly reflects this evolution: from sorting a single list to sorting each sublist and aggregating via sum. It correctly understands that the new solution composes the original `sort_numeric_strings` function over each sublist and then applies `sum`, and that the output type changes from a single sorted list to a list of sums. This shows a correct grasp of the relationship between raw and new problems.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Even though the prompt frames the code as obfuscated, the provided snippets are short and structurally clear. Qwen did not rely on variable names; instead, it inferred behavior from the list comprehension, `int` conversion, `sorted`, and `sum` usage. For the new solution, it correctly inferred that `sort_numeric_strings(sublist)` returns a numerically sorted list of integers and that `sum(...)` then aggregates them. The descriptions are tightly coupled to the actual operations rather than any naming semantics, indicating strong robustness to obfuscation in this instance.",

        "Precisely captured the input and output types for both raw and new problems (numeric strings → integers, list vs. list of lists).",
        "Explicitly recognized the numeric nature of sorting via integer conversion rather than lexicographic sorting.",
        "Correctly identified the higher-order structure in the new problem: mapping the original operation over sublists and then summing.",
        "Accurately described the final outputs: sorted list for raw, list of sums for new.",
        "Showed clear understanding of the relationship between the two problems and the reuse of the original function."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention that the order of elements in each sublist after sorting is preserved only for the purpose of summing (a minor, largely irrelevant nuance).",
        "Did not explicitly state that the numeric sorting is guaranteed by the `int` conversion step in the new problem (though this is strongly implied from the raw problem description)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated a complete and accurate understanding of the code's semantics, including data types, control flow, and functional composition. It correctly abstracted from concrete operations (`int`, `sorted`, `sum`, list comprehensions) to a high-level problem description that matches the ground truth almost verbatim. The model also correctly perceived the evolution from a base operation (numeric sorting of a single list of strings) to a composed operation over nested structures (per-sublist sorting plus aggregation). This indicates strong capability to infer problem intent from code structure, even when naming is uninformative, and to reason about how a helper function is reused in a more complex setting."
