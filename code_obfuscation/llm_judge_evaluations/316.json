      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth raw problem: toggle bits of a number except the first and last bit. The obfuscated code converts n to binary, keeps the first and last bits unchanged, and flips the bits in between, then converts back to int. Qwen's description: \"takes an integer n, converts it to its binary representation, toggles all bits except the first and last, and then converts it back to an integer.\" This matches the semantics exactly: correct input type (integer), correct operation (toggle middle bits only), and correct output (integer after reconversion). No important detail is missing or wrong.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: for a list of numbers, toggle the bits of each number except the first and last bit, then sum the results and return the sum. The obfuscated code: `return sum(toggle_middle_bits(a7b_3m) for a7b_3m in numbers)` clearly applies the previously defined toggling function to each element and sums them. Qwen's description: \"calculates the sum of integers obtained by toggling the middle bits of each number in the list 'numbers'.\" This is fully aligned with the ground truth: it captures the list input, per-element middle-bit toggling, and summation of results. The phrase \"middle bits\" is consistent with \"except the first and last bit\" from the raw problem.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: (1) define an operation on a single integer (toggle all bits except first and last), then (2) extend it to a list by mapping that operation over each element and summing the results. Qwen's raw and new descriptions reflect exactly this relationship: the raw description defines the per-integer behavior; the new description describes applying that behavior to each element of a list and summing. This shows a correct understanding of how the new problem builds directly on the raw problem's function.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated variable names (`q9z_8x`, `w2r_5t`, `a7b_3m`), Qwen correctly inferred semantics from the structure: `bin(n)[2:]` to get the binary string, slicing `[1:-1]` to isolate middle bits, a comprehension that flips '0'/'1', and reconstruction with first and last bits preserved. For the new solution, it recognized a generator expression applying `toggle_middle_bits` to each element of `numbers` and summing. This indicates Qwen relied on control flow and operations rather than names, showing strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the core operation of toggling all bits except the first and last for a single integer.",
        "Correctly identified input and output types for both raw and new problems.",
        "Accurately described the list-level aggregation (map then sum) in the new problem.",
        "Recognized the relationship between the base function and its use in the higher-level list-summing function.",
        "Showed no reliance on variable names; reasoning was based on code structure and operations."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "No substantive weaknesses for this particular problem; the descriptions are essentially exact matches to the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "For this problem, Qwen demonstrated full semantic understanding of the obfuscated code. It correctly interpreted binary manipulation via slicing and comprehension, and then recognized the higher-order pattern of applying that operation across a list and summing. The alignment between its inferred descriptions and the ground truth—both at the single-number level and the list-aggregation level—shows that Qwen can abstract the intended behavior from low-level operations even when naming is unhelpful. This is a strong example of robust code semantics understanding under obfuscation."
