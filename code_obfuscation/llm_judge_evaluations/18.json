      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the nth octagonal number, which follows a specific figurate-number formula (3n^2 - 2n). The obfuscated raw solution is exactly `return 3 * a7x_9 * a7x_9 - 2 * a7x_9`, i.e., the octagonal-number formula with a7x_9 as n.\n\nQwen's description: \"The code calculates and returns the result of a quadratic expression involving the variable a7x_9.\" This is mathematically correct at a very superficial level (it is indeed a quadratic expression in a7x_9), but it completely misses the semantic meaning that this is the nth octagonal number. There is no mention of figurate numbers, octagonal numbers, or any number-theoretic context.\n\nThus, while Qwen did not misdescribe the computation, it failed to recognize or state the core semantic purpose. Accuracy is low because the key concept (octagonal number) is absent, and completeness is minimal.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth new problem: For each integer in a list, compute the sum of the first 10 octagonal numbers for that integer, with the rule that if the integer is less than 1, return 0 for that element. The code shows: iterate over m8r_lst; if b4t_w < 1, append 0; else compute `sum(v2h_fn(k_8x) for k_8x in range(1, min(b4t_w, 10) + 1))` and append that sum. Given the original context, v2h_fn is the octagonal-number function.\n\nQwen's description: \"The code processes a list m8r_lst, applying a conditional summation to each element based on its value, and returns a new list with the results.\" This captures the high-level control flow: iterating over a list, conditionally summing something depending on each element's value, and returning a list of results. However, it misses the crucial semantic detail that the summation is over octagonal numbers (via v2h_fn) and that the range is from 1 to min(b4t_w, 10), i.e., the \"first up to 10\" terms. It also doesn't explicitly state the behavior for values < 1 (return 0), only vaguely alluding to \"conditional summation\".\n\nSo Qwen understood the structural behavior (map-like transformation with conditional sum) but not the mathematical semantics or the specific constraints (octagonal numbers, cap at 10). Hence moderate semantic accuracy but low completeness.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw→new transformation in the ground truth is: start from computing a single nth octagonal number, then move to a list-processing problem where for each integer you sum the first up to 10 octagonal numbers (using the same base function) with a guard for integers < 1.\n\nQwen's raw description is just \"quadratic expression\" and its new description is \"conditional summation over a list\". It does not connect the two via the shared octagonal-number function or recognize that the new problem builds on the raw one by repeatedly applying that same function and summing results. There is no indication that Qwen saw the relationship between v2h_fn and the earlier quadratic formula, or that the new problem is an aggregation of the raw problem's core operation.\n\nThus, its understanding of the transformation is weak: it captures that the new code adds list processing and conditional summation, but not that the underlying mathematical concept (octagonal numbers) is preserved and extended.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "The obfuscation is mainly in variable names (a7x_9, m8r_lst, v2h_fn, etc.), but the structure and formula are clear. A robust semantic understanding would recognize 3n^2 - 2n as the standard formula for octagonal numbers and then see v2h_fn as that same function used inside a summation.\n\nQwen appears to rely only on surface-level structure: it correctly identifies a quadratic expression and a list-processing pattern with conditional summation, but it does not infer the deeper semantic meaning (octagonal numbers) or the specific role of v2h_fn. The obfuscation of the function name likely contributed to missing that v2h_fn is the same octagonal-number function, but the formula itself is explicit enough that a stronger semantic model could have recognized it.\n\nTherefore, robustness to obfuscation is limited: Qwen handled control-flow semantics reasonably but failed to recover the mathematical semantics that were still visible despite obfuscation.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Failed to recognize or mention that the quadratic expression corresponds to the nth octagonal number.",
        "Did not identify that v2h_fn represents the same underlying octagonal-number function used in the raw problem.",
        "Omitted key constraints in the new problem, such as summing only up to the first 10 terms (min(b4t_w, 10)).",
        "Did not explicitly describe the behavior for integers less than 1 (returning 0), only vaguely referencing conditional summation.",
        "Did not articulate the conceptual relationship between the raw and new problems (single octagonal number vs. sums of first up to 10 octagonal numbers per list element)."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrates a basic ability to parse control flow and arithmetic structure even with obfuscated names: it can say \"quadratic expression\" and \"conditional summation over a list\". However, it does not go beyond syntactic description to recover the intended mathematical semantics (octagonal numbers) or the higher-level problem transformation. This suggests that, at least in this instance, Qwen's code understanding is more syntactic than semantic: it recognizes patterns like loops, conditionals, and arithmetic forms, but does not map recognizable formulas to their domain concepts or track that a helper function in the new code is the same as the raw problem's core computation. Obfuscation of names exacerbates this, but the main limitation is the lack of deeper semantic inference from the explicit formula."
