      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Qwen's inferred raw problem description matches the ground truth exactly in semantics. Ground truth: \"find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices.\" Qwen: \"calculates the sum of elements in a list from index m to n inclusive.\" It correctly captures that the input is a list, the operation is summing, and the range is defined by indices m and n inclusive. The inclusivity detail (n inclusive) is explicitly stated and matches the code slice `m : n + 1`. There are no missing or incorrect aspects.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "For the new problem, the ground truth is: given a list of lists and a range (m, n), sum all numbers in each sublist within that range and return the total sum of these sums. Qwen's description: \"calculates the total sum of elements from index m to n inclusive across multiple sublists within a list of lists.\" This is semantically equivalent: it recognizes the structure (list of lists), the per-sublist range restriction, and that the result is a single total sum aggregating across sublists. It correctly reflects the behavior of the obfuscated code, which iterates over sublists and calls the range-summing helper on each. No important detail is missing or wrong.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The transformation from raw to new problem is: extend a single-list range sum to a list-of-lists, aggregating the range sum over each sublist. Qwen's raw and new descriptions preserve exactly this relationship: the raw problem is a range sum on one list; the new problem is the same operation applied to each sublist and then totaled. This shows that Qwen understood that the new solution reuses the original functionality (`sum_r4ng3_l1st`) inside a loop over sublists, and that the conceptual evolution is from a single structure to a nested structure with aggregation. Thus, its understanding of the transformation is fully correct.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `l1st_0f_l1sts`, `t0t4l_sum`, and `sum_r4ng3_l1st`, Qwen correctly inferred the semantics from the control flow and operations: iterating over each sublist, calling a helper that sums a slice from m to n, and accumulating into a total. It did not rely on variable names to guess behavior; instead it aligned its description with the actual operations (slicing with `m : n + 1`, summing, looping over sublists). This indicates strong robustness to obfuscation for this problem.",
      "strengths": [
        "Precisely captured the core semantics of the raw function: summing a slice of a list between two indices inclusive.",
        "Accurately described the new function as applying the same range-sum logic across multiple sublists and aggregating the results.",
        "Explicitly noted the inclusive nature of the index range, matching the `n + 1` slice bound.",
        "Correctly recognized the structural transformation from single list to list of lists with aggregation.",
        "Showed no dependence on variable naming; relied on code structure and operations instead."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "No substantive weaknesses for this particular problem; the descriptions are already concise and fully aligned with the ground truth."
      ],
      "key_insights": "This example shows that Qwen can cleanly abstract the semantics of simple numerical operations even when identifiers are heavily obfuscated. It not only matched the ground truth descriptions but also preserved the conceptual relationship between the base problem and its extension (single list → list of lists with aggregation). The model appears to reason from slicing, summation, and looping patterns rather than from variable names, which is exactly the kind of structural understanding desired in the presence of obfuscation."
