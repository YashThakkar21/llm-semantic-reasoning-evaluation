      "raw_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the volume of a cube given its side length. Code: `return l ** 3`. Qwen: \"calculates the cube of a given number 'l'.\" Mathematically, volume of a cube with side l is l^3, so describing it as \"cube of a number\" is fully semantically correct for what the code does. It captures the input (a single length) and the operation (raising to the third power). The only thing not explicitly verbalized is the word \"volume\", but the functional behavior is exactly described.",
      "new_problem_evaluation": "Ground truth: compute the total volume of multiple cubes given a list of side lengths. Code: iterate over `s1d3_l3ngth5`, sum `v0lum3_cub3(l)` into `t0t4l_v0lum3`, return it. Qwen: \"calculates the total volume by summing up the cubes of multiple lengths stored in the list 's1d3_l3ngth5'.\" This matches the semantics perfectly: it recognizes a list of lengths, per-element cubing, and summation to get a total volume. Again, it doesn’t explicitly say \"cubes\" as geometric objects, but \"total volume\" and \"cubes of multiple lengths\" together clearly imply that. All key aspects (list input, per-element operation, accumulation, return of total) are present.",
      "transformation_analysis": "The raw problem is about a single cube’s volume; the new problem generalizes to multiple cubes and sums their volumes. Qwen’s descriptions reflect exactly this transformation: from \"cube of a given number\" to \"total volume by summing up the cubes of multiple lengths stored in the list\". It correctly understands that the new function repeatedly applies the original operation and aggregates the results. This shows a clear grasp of the relationship between the two problems: the new one is a list-based extension/aggregation of the scalar version.",
      "obfuscation_handling": "Despite obfuscated names like `s1d3_l3ngth5`, `t0t4l_v0lum3`, and `v0lum3_cub3`, Qwen inferred the correct semantics from the control flow and arithmetic: iterating over a list, cubing each element, and summing. It did not rely on the misleading or noisy naming but instead on the structure: a loop over a collection, accumulation into a total, and returning that total. Its interpretation aligns with what the code actually computes, showing strong robustness to obfuscation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identified that `l ** 3` represents the core operation (cubing the input), which is the mathematical basis for cube volume.",
        "Correctly recognized the list-based aggregation pattern in the new solution: iterate over a list, cube each element, sum results.",
        "Captured the notion of \"total volume\" in the new problem, aligning with the ground truth intent.",
        "Understood the transformation from single-value computation to multi-value aggregation.",
        "Was not misled by obfuscated variable names and relied on code structure and operations."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Did not explicitly mention \"cube\" as a geometric object or \"side length\" in the raw problem description, instead using more generic mathematical language (\"cube of a number\").",
        "Similarly, in the new problem, it did not explicitly say \"multiple cubes\" as objects, though this is strongly implied."
      ],
      "key_insights": "Qwen demonstrated that it can abstract away from naming and focus on the mathematical and structural behavior of the code. Even with obfuscated identifiers, it correctly inferred that the core operation is cubing a scalar and that the extended version applies this operation over a list and sums the results. Its descriptions are slightly more mathematical than geometric (\"cube of a number\" vs. \"volume of a cube\"), but this does not detract from semantic correctness. The perfect alignment between the inferred and ground truth transformations indicates strong understanding of how small functional units are reused and composed in code."
